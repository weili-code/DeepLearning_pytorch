Let's not forget that Apple Pay in 2014 required a brand new iPhone in order to use it.  A significant portion of Apple's user base wasn't able to use it even if they wanted to.  As each successive iPhone incorporated the technology and older iPhones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased.,1.0

"Whenever I go to a place that doesn’t take Apple Pay (doesn’t happen too often), it’s such a drag. Between ‘contactless Covid’ habits and my getting the Apple Card, I’ve gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it. It feels like a shock, it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine! I’ve officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket.",0.0

Linus!!! Just turn the key lights  180 and bounce them off the walls. You’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting. It’s such a simple fix. I’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face 😅,2.0

"Guys, a quick note that you do NOT need all the high-end tech in order to do well at college. If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets. Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.",1.0
"this is hilarious. i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for Best Buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for Back to School. One of the kids next to me said ""Maybe you should have someone like MKBHD talk about your products"". Well... here we are",1.0
"Everyone has been saying it but I’ll throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job I’m working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.",2.0

Personally I feel like this is really out of touch. Most students won't be able to afford these. In case anyone needs it: I believe Dave2D's back to school video are honestly the best ones I've seen on the topic. Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision.,2.0
"Hey everyone. Good take on the video and love the recommendations. If you plan on making another video such as this, maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options. 

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what courses/programme you took for your education.
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software. I'm not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops.

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

"I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).",2.0

"Regarding Cans vs. Bottles: At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly, since they get used again and again. You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop, they then get sent to a cleaning plant, where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water. Afterwards they get reused for beer. The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard, so different brewers use the same bottles.

It's far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans.",1.0

"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

"Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well. Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely don't tell you this when you buy your hardware and services.",0.0
"Points that were missed: 

- Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multi-platform messaging apps. This weirdly only applies in the States. The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger ( both owned by meta, Which is its own issue). That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. 

- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. 

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there. Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones, so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software.",1.0

"In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is ""rewarded"" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time.

"I have a high paying tech job that I’m about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly I’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year.

"The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially. Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows they're taking time off.

"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so

"AI is the most important one, a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness, consciousness at some point.
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it, etc. etc.
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens.",1.0

"@MKBHD I""m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)",2.0

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that.",0.0

"Something important to know, for all who are interested in history and/or support Ukraine: 

Rus’ ought not to be confused with “Russia”, which derives its name from the Rus’ but historically is a completely different state, which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus’. 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany, Russia is actually Muscovy, despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise. 

Its name “Russia"" received only in 1721, when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovy’s name into the “Russian” Empire (“Russia” originates from Rosia, name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus')
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites, and were forced to call themselves “Russian”. 

Lands that “Russia” claims were part of the original Rus’, but actually weren't, are Novgorod, Suzdal, and Ryazan, since in historical texts of XI-XII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus’. They can be considered parts of extended Rus’, although their culture was distinct from main Rus’.

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus’. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus’ ownership.

“Russia” is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and “Russian” historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn’t mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that’s exactly what “Russia” did in regards to Rus’-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!",1.0

Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery.

"Netflix is getting into video games for the same reason Apple is launching a car and Amazon is getting into healthcare. These high high tech company have to constantly keep growing in order to justify their insane valuations, and in many cases their core businesses wont offer enough revenue to satisfy investors growth expectations",1.0
Netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors. This move into gaming will not do them any favours.,0.0
"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.",0.0

People also don’t typically like when YouTubers are given a large budget like with YouTube Red originals, so Netflix buying out certain YouTubers is not the right idea…",0.0

I'm surprised getting all the collectibles didn't even get an honorable mention.

"The original infamous hurt my soul. I played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while I was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy can't be completed post game. I had all but one stunt, to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once. When you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers, therefore there isn't enough enemies to get the stunt. I didn't have it in me to start another campaign. The sad part is I had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt.",0.0

"I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward.

In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games.",0.0
"When I think about the games I played the last few years, I must say, that I almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big IPs. So I rather pay 30€ for an indie title, that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€+ on a broken AAA title without any innovations.",2.0

"I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now. The gaming industry has changed for a while now, and its only getting worse. I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems).

"I've been around for every console generation.  I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking ""256-bit"" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.

What's your DREAM spec/size for a gaming monitor?,1.0
"Wow I'm impressed, think they've set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42""",2.0
This monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels. I like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well. Nice video,2.0
"On your future review, will you give us a comprehensive analysis on the anti-glare matte screen? Is the matte coating embedded within the panel or is it another layer? Do you notice any sacrifices on color and sharpness because of the matte finish? Do you find its brightness setting to be adequate for an OLED monitor during productivity use? How aggressive is ABL in your testing? Please let us know. Thank you!",1.0
My favorite part of this tv (42'' is basically tv size) is the custom heatsink. I don't care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesn't dim the brightness constantly.,2.0
Great video! I think I'll still be leaning toward the C2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing.,2.0
"Awesome review! What are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the LG C2 42? Does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality? I want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the C2 at a cheaper price, this, or perhaps wait another year for something new?",2.0
"OLED Gaming
Wow, please compare to the C2 you had as a monitor? side by side to see that contrast difference, uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the C2 42 and this. Love your content",2.0
"Thanks for the review, i can't wait for your full review!

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

Thanks!",2.0
"Hi @SpawnPoiint, I'm looking forward to the complete review, you're the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer I've seen.

One thing I'd like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen, ideally a side-by-side in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer.
Don't know if that's feasible for you. In any case thanks for the work and enjoy :)",2.0

Theory; why Karl has a wierd collision box: he's a mesh that's not supposed to be in the game but evreyone likes him so the devs just left him,1.0
theory: the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like Cristine. Karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and they're soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones (he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back) and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan. it also explains why he keeps coming back,1.0

Gotta love Lenovo. Got the Ryzen 5600H version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and I couldn't have been happier. It was 700€ in Italy at the time.

"The part where they're talking about the initial rollout of the SNES in North America hits home. They mention something about how expensive it was for the time, and how the state of the US economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only ""toy"" the average American parent could buy their kids that year. Took up the entire toy budget.

That happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.

It was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly. We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day. It's a great family memory that we all still hold with us, now all in our 40's and 50's with families of our own.",1.0

"14:42, this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me. Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses, this one's just different. The game was over lol. It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards. Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history.",0.0

For ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes.

"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said ""I got bored with the game"".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and ""The Play"" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many ""crazy"" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. 😂",2.0

Haven't seen a Newcastle side play that well (against Man City no less) in a very long time. 

Gutted but grateful to get a point in the end.  Just a heroic team performance. Could single every player in the starting XI out for praise.  Just so proud of all of them.

As for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager.",2.0

The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality. I probably wouldn't be averse to a loan though, it can't be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week.",0.0
One question I have is will Ten Hag play Casemiro when he joins United? Or will he stick to the 2 greatest midfielders ever played football Mctominay and Fred?,1.0
"The reality is that, when he was at Ajax, Ten Hag didn't choose the players. At Ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players.... At Manchester United.....🤷‍♂️",2.0
"We are a absolute mess. If Casemiro was the target why wasn't he signed 2 months ago?. We just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man. Im not saying Casemiro is a rubbish player, he is quality. Its just Man Utd's approach to signings is a joke. Plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week. ( but ill literally take anything over Scott and Fred ).",0.0

When the defense lacks solidity, all areas of the game suffer. His presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team, including Martinez, who was also much more efficient.

Sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little.",1.0

Toadette knew that Friend wasn't a danger to fish-kind. The movie drop subtext hints that, like Starship Troopers, the ""monsters"" weren't the random violent one; Gruner started it. Likely by killing some/many of them, and fish-napping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight. 

Peace was plenty possible and Friend figured it out, he just wasn't very smart as shown in the rest of the video. All he had to do was offer them Gruner, at least at that point. 

Even at the beginning of the movie, we're set to think he's going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door; but that's the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies. They were curious, sure, and maybe marking the territory, but they weren't attack-oriented until after Friend got antsy.

I've always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and I come across as confident most of the times, to the point where people are surprised when I tell them I have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do.

Maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation. So you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react. Watch how they move when they tell the truth. Figure out their “normal”. Then, you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation. You are looking for *clusters* of indicators - not isolated indicators.",1.0

"The guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use. Agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people, their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person. They know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits. And most importantly, none of this can be used too convict you. They can't just say ""yep he's the murderer, he is lying"" and throw you in prison. It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too, or who they should focus on. They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you. If you didn't do it, they can't convict you just because you seemed like you were lying.",0.0
I remember I was in an argument with a friend if mine and I crossed my arms. She instantly called me out on it and said if I'm being open and honest then why did I cross my arms.

"Well, I have finished watching it, and I found it really useful. Here are some lessons I learnt.
I don't have time = It is not a priority
Time is a choice, it is elastic.
We have enough time, almost all of us. Make the experiences enjoyable, such as, you can read or listen to a book while commuting. 

Get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis. 

Focus on what matters and you will build the live you want",2.0
"Make yourself a three-category priority list for the coming week: career, relationships, self and there should be 2-3 items in each category, small moments can have great power. you can use your bits of time for bits of joy. Even if we are busy we have time for what matters. (quoting her)",2.0
"We are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments. But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.
I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. 
Making a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. 
Or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that. 
Thanks for the inspiring talk. I'm getting back to work now. Time to review my priority list.",1.0
"""We don't build the lives we want  by saving time. We build the lives we want and time saves itself."" ❤",2.0
"I've had varying work schedules and it was incredibly hard to adjust to night shifts at first mainly because it was hard to find time to hang out with friends and family. This video has taught me that priorities can change. They might take some getting used to, but it showed me that a night job doesn't have to mean no social life.",1.0
""" Every minute I spend is my choice "" how great is this sentence",2.0
"I like her approach and It's partly right but I do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we don't count them as priorities. For example,  it's not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 23:00. The opportunities for doing certain things are less (kids are in bed, shops are closed etc.) Also, when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and it's not super easy to happen",1.0

"I know at least 5 ways to deal with them:

1. Never take their words personally. Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.
2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.
3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.
4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.
5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you. Keep your distance and value your boundaries. Protect yourself.",0.0
"You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you.  True power is sitting back and observing things with logic.  True power is restraint.  If words control you that means everyone else can control you.  Breathe, and allow things to pass.",1.0

"Cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level. People who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view. Someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them, money. Unfortunately, office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded.

I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own ""motivations"" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you.",1.0

"For the platform game, just have each person make a prolonged sound while slowly going and laying down on the platform. That way, you can easily tell if there’s a wall between you and them by whether the sound changes :)",1.0
"21:52 I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be enough to destroy his plan. If let's say one of the three people with the wall managed to answer the question correctly, that's still 2 options eliminated. And with how fast Shirube came up with his  first plan, he had more than enough time to devise a second test to figure which of the remaining two directions was the correct one.",1.0
"For the platform game, I think the second go was almost perfect. If he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question, then it would’ve been foolproof. Like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person, then asked everyone which hand held the coin. That’s not a perfect solution, but that’s the kind of question I’m thinking of. One where if you choose an obvious answer you know they’re lying, and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer",1.0
"In the platform game, what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it. Since there's only a small opening in the center, they wouldn't be able to do it, and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work.",1.0
This guy’s definetly a genius.,2.0
"For the spinning platform I have an easier solution, once you see which way is safe to jump, and they put the mask on, put your hand on one of the corners of the platform while facing the safe area, now when the platform rotates count how many turns it has made by feeling with your free hand the position of your hand on the corner being able to count how many rotations made gives you the idea of where you are and where to jump",1.0

There was one single semester in undergrad that I was able to set my schedule up so that everyday I had a class start at 10:00 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6.

Having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep I ever felt (it was also the most consistent I’ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports) Followed by a semester where classes started at either 8:30 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mental-health wise,2.0
"I have PTSD and clinical depression, so I always feel tired. I've been subjected to things I wouldn't wish on anyone, and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now.

"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the ""SPECIAL KIDS"". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort. I hope you have a great day and I wish you all the best ☺️. NEVER GIVE UP.",1.0

"Hi Jatz, thank you for another valuable video. Question: What if Amazon tells me to request for an approval to list a product?

"Realizing that no matter what happens, I'll be okay, is exactly how I survived my childhood. I used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists, I realized if I survived all that, I will survive whatever else comes my way and that's when I stopped stressing as much. I hadn't really connected it with confidence before but I can see the connection now. Interesting. 🤔",2.0
"I feel like a big part of Don's character is that even HE has his own issues with self-confidence, but he never let's people see that. When he does, that's when we start to see the layers peel back and Don's true self starts to show.

You can stand in any way you want, dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king Solomon blush, but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it. Love yourself, know you’re worthy, and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside. Don’t try and be or imitate someone else, be who you are and love it. One thing this video gets right: Know you’re gonna be ok no matter what. ‘Nough said, love to you all xxx",2.0

"If you spend time getting to know yourself, and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life, the one you have with yourself.

"Just a reminder: for older motherboards or cost-cut motherboards, if you have a CPU with iGPU or onboard graphics solution, even if you have a graphics card there is a good chance that it will default to the motherboard's graphics solution first and you will need to configure the BIOS to use the external graphics for pre-boot display.

"Hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven… there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it.  So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.",1.0

"The biggest thing I've realized lately is that the more money you have, the more money you will want to spend.
So you never really feel like you have enough.
That's why I really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have.
This is especially true of us in the first world.
We get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff, that they are ""living the dream"".
But the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles.
And if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach.

The irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most.
They have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need.
So when they come to live here and get a job, they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff.
Their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money.
But the family doesn't realize that the ""cost of living is much higher"" where we live.

I’m an engineer and I work with batteries as a hobby. There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is “protected” and the other is “unprotected”. 

The protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. 

Lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. 

So why don’t people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly.",2.0

"To summarize the CODE for building the 2nd brain:
C - Capture: use note-taking apps or picture to store information.
O - Organise: ask ""Where will I use this information?""
D - Distill: progressive summarization
E - Express: show your work",1.0
"SUMMARY NOTES:
00:00 Intro
-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.

-The ""second brain"" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.

-The ""second brain"" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.

-The ""second brain"" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.

00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?
- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.

- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. 

- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.

- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).

04:56 C (Capture)
- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.

-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.

- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.

- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

08:32 O (Organise)
- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.

- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.

- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.

- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.

11:07 D (Distill)
- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.

- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

11:45 E (Express)
-The ""E"" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.

-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.

-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.

13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali
-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.

-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. 

-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information.",2.0

As for the video idea, perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs? I believe burnouts burn creativity. You want to push, but you just mentally can't. I've dealt with it in the past, but Im getting out of it now since the company I want to work for actually hit me up to work with them. It gave me a boost!",2.0
"Your Book Club series is one of the most useful series on YouTube. I have a commonplace book in Evernote and I'm always amazed at the gems I've come across over the years.

"To absorb what one reads, it's crucial to master concentration. When I started reading in my early youth, my mind would wander before finishing a page. Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain. Schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning.",2.0
I was born into a relatively poor family.  Never had the opportunity to go to college.  I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.,2.0
Be a teacher but forever a student. Listening in itself is a lost art. So difficult to run across a good listener. Joe Rogan comes to mind. I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest. I don't necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts. What I like about Joe is he gives his guest's time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs ( or agenda like so many on the tell a vision).  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort.,2.0

"Everybody, you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds. I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun.

I subbed to this amazing channel back when it had just 60k subs. I have been here since almost a year now. Time flies by for sure. 
I don't have a lot to say about this video since it's pretty technical. I'm not really a huge fan of trucks. I will say, however, that I want you guys to get back to this guy and see how he's doing in a couple years. This guy definitely thinks big and I love that. He is such a huge inspiration. I have started my affiliate marketing and already made $7k in just 6 months. It's nothing compared to the amount of money he makes, but we will get there for sure. 
Kudos to you guys again. You are doing such an amazing job. Can you please make the vending machine video (I believe you made one) go live? I would love that. Thanks.
Also, what happened to the Q&A bliz? You didn't do it this time. Why? I was interested in knowing what books he reads, if any.

"i’m late 17 and my business started really randomly and unexpectedly lol, I wanted to buy some leather goods but the prices killed me so i was like “ya know what im cheap im gonna make my own stuff” and spent tons of time on youtube and google learning and messing up and leaning new things from the ways i messed up, then my family was impressed by the finished result which surprised me and they told me i should start a business so i was like welp why not give it a shot, and i’ve only very recently started but so far Alhamdulillah i’ve been blessed and it’s going better than id imagined the beginning would go; 

moral of the story is be cheap, learn a skill from that cheapness and capitalize on that, in my first week i made more than in a month at previous jobs i’ve had throughout high school and i’ve actually been able to enjoy it, learn things while making
money, and look at all of my work and feel fulfilled and happy unlike any of my other jobs",2.0

Cigarettes is another one, BAT share price just goes up and up. Warren Buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits.

I've gradually built my finance and made my first $100k through investing which i've used to start my jewellery business, and with what I’ve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out.

"If you are going to start a vending business, giving customers the option to use cards will increase your sales a ton. Fewer people carry cash, especially in small denominations.

Although I disagree about some other business models generalizations. For example, on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once, it's an option, there's revenue sharing, pay per sale etc.

From dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle (costumer).
The margins game is highly variable and that's where some people get ahead of others.

Nevertheless, selling ROI Services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency... Website, content and all.",2.0

Making a dress is a journey for all the people involved, that is how innovation happens. These animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort :) It is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money.

"Love the breakdown. I started my first business from money I made off dividends. With what I’ve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.",2.0
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. what most people see at a glance-wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..",2.0

"Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for, Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it.

The ‘offer to work for free’ thing is surprisingly rare but great advice. I took a gamble and emailed a company I covered in my psychology BSc to ask if I could come work for them for free and they gave me a paid gig as a trial. 16 years later and I’m now Managing Director. In all those years not one person has attempted the same thing.,2.0

"For sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great. The best quote I heard was ""Nobody is expecting you to do something amazing, but it is amazing when you do something"".  The reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global, but you might build something that brings value, and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different.  You can only admire what Elon Musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future.",2.0

"Great video.  But let me talk about something important, I see many young and old make mistakes that I think should not be.  I believe that everyone, young or old, should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures.  The investment can be your retirement plan or future plan, depending on what you want, but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable.",2.0
It's touching to hear Elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation. My mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life & disabled her. The impact of her brain health affected my development/life and my brain health. The genetic component also affected my brain health. Currently I'm functionally disabled from it too. It's a constant chronic hell cycle. It's comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as Elon Musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother & I.,1.0

"At 2:24, Elon says something quite profound. 

""Entrepreneurs are born of everyday"". This resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people, with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday. They are problem solvers. It's quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses.",2.0

"I LOVE THIS INTERVIEW!!

I've been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years. We moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles. I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church. I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. 

One of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all.",2.0

"It< makes sense,  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize.   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. I’d get involved more knowing that I have made over 7 btc and 15ETH from day-trade with Leroy Davids Crypto in few weeks",1.0
"As you can see we are already in August and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from LIBERTON CORP would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about.",2.0

I don't watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if I were to watch the news everyday.  Now I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over £728k from day trading with Liberton Corp Signal in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish....",1.0
LIBERTONCORP is young.  Holding almost anything mentioned here is a good hold because the VHS or Beta will only show in time.  I want to hold them early.  Its sad that most dont think of these things as good future holds instead of being out of the market and bottom hunting.  Are we the adopters or are we scavengers?  surely one of these layer ones will become the standard and i dont want to sell any of them too early.,1.0
"I sincerely appreciate the work you've done and the knowledge you share. Technical analysis can be helpful, but I think It is quite puzzling that well-known cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure T.A and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems. Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous. We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps. Day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the market's situation.  trading daily with LIBERTONCORP I have earned over $ 12BTC using his insights and charts. His insight has always been a step ahead of others..",1.0

"keep <,up the great work. You are truly an asset to the community. Thanks, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP . I made 12BTC from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market I’m still bagging more money",2.0

"High fashion is sometimes very abstract, very elitist, very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous. But if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too, you find artisans, people who study and excel in a craft. They deserve to be highlighted more. Behind that overpriced Chanel bag is a leather/chain/fabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion. Fast fashion is slowly killing our planet (water consumption, landfills, toxic chemical dumped in village waters, people paid pennies etc), haute couture is rare, it’s scarce. I find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but I love my high end pieces, that have lasted me years and will continue to do so. Behind these fashion shows are artisans, that will always be better than any fast producing machine.",0.0
Imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry; but I truly believe he holds just as much influence. This series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designers/industry professionals taking note. Imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power.,2.0
"Luxury fashion is one of the world's biggest industries. I think this is a great topic for a Bloomberg series. I would be interested is seeing more of this type of content. I am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga, especially now that I know they both come under the Kering umbrella. Other recent collaborations include Versace and Fendi, which could be the subject of another video. The more recent video in this series examines the Chinese market, and how fashion brands are now targeting young Asian consumers.",2.0
The worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic. They’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same.,0.0
"I love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich. Like what really is the point here? Is it the small artisans who get $$ and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design,  exploit labor, and sell for profit? 🥱 The definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care.",0.0
"I used to love high fashion, but the more I learn about what goes on in the industry the more I feel like pursuing a different career choice, so much nepotism, elitism, and lack of creativity. it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves, you’re not welcomed.",0.0

"Hamza, I just wanted to say thank you, brother. I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.",2.0

"It’s buyer behavior. It goes beyond buying up multiple sizes to see what fits. I’ve sold on eBay for years with no issue. Same individual item again and again. One year I sold on Amazon and I was blown away by the types of buyers I had. Many requested a cancellation of purchase, which I gladly did. I don’t want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made. Many also requested a return claiming the item was defective, but when I paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to Amazons return policies, the item would be returned in perfect working condition. I don’t know if people are buying suggested items without thinking, or assuming they’ll get something free if they complain, but I can’t imagine the horror if I had to trash every single return I got. Sometimes, after paying for the return shipping label, the buyer would never ship. All they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup, but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie.",1.0

"The first thing I want you to know,whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus.
I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  I am going to say the words that you need to say.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And Jesus Christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life.  
Let us pray.

Dear God in Heaven.
I come to you.
I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived.
The things I have done.
Please forgive me.
Cleanse me.
With your precious blood.
From every sin, I have ever committed.
Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus.
And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead.
And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life.
And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.  
We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen.",2.0

I just love his way of teaching, it’s excellent.  Precise, not overly wordy and simple, and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output.  

Seriously he is the best.  Great speaker and presenter.

Edit:  Just a note, but Mike even explained loops which also occur in SQL and it’s something I honestly haven’t ever really fully grasped before but because of this video I finally get it.  This actually is going to positively effect my job too, not just my hobby.

Of course, back then, a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me, and this video perhaps wasn’t the most beginner friendly. However, I was so sick of my job and I absolutely saw no growth in doing cable, where the salary cap for a technician was probably IT jobs base pay for the most part, so I decided to Google every single thing I don’t understand.

"The minecraft way:
Step 1: Build a 'temporary' box house or cave home
Step 2: After playing for awhile and gathering materials, prepare to build your new house
Step 3: Look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration
Step 4: Realize that to accomplish any of those, you'll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time
Step 5: Stop playing for 8 months
Step 6: Start playing again, but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing
Step 7: Decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world
Step 8: Return to step 1",0.0

"Just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building, this is NOT the only tutorial you need, not even remotely. Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics, ie what they are and how to execute them. You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one. But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great, pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it.





Also if you want to get really into building, I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials, and once you've gotten to a decently advanced level, watching tutorials from another, far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace - Minecraft. he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft, in my opinion, even better than grian is, though they do build in vastly different ways so there isn't much comparison that works there.",1.0

oh myy i was hoping you'd do a face tutorial! your techniques are always so easy to follow along with and help a lot ❤️,2.0
"This was CRAZY!!! I used different colors for the different lines for each thing like the nose was florescent orange, the circles for the skull were turquoise, the sunglasses area for the eyes were hot pink and the box for the mouth is grass green. Then I did as you did and used black to put in the features (Oh the shoulders and neck on the one from the side are turquoise). 
It sounds like it would be a huge mess but I used the colors to make  key saying what color is for what structure and hmmmm.....if I keep practicing this I will gain so much so fast. And I eat shading out aside from some hair. 
She looks bonkers but as long as I understand it, hey, my sketchbook is colorful!",1.0

"The two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence (Chernobyl) and 2 natural disaster (Fukushima). As a British citizen I would say, that on the most part, we are very capable of preventing those two things. We’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion, let’s get those plants running baby.",0.0
"I think anyone who has spent time working in a modern, agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant: we no longer plan past the next quarter.  ""Supply chain bottleneck"" is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show, and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict (cerveza).   The system is brittle by design, because it's so much cheaper that way.    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.  Instead we've been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home, gutting workforces, funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain / skill loss as the old timers machinists retire, but hey, we delivered a lot of value for shareholders.   And now the chickens are coming home to roost.",0.0
"Germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy. Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence. Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable, concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer, but without the emissions. Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclear/fossil fuels. I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants, using the same small plots of land. With Renewable, it requires covering vast amounts of land with solar/wind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is wind/solar. This land should be used for farming or nature preserves, not renewables.  If the solar is using worthless land, such as the desert maybe it makes senses, but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaning/maintenance needed due to the dust. Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem, but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high. Not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties.",1.0

"Nuclear is a great carbon-free base load electricity source. I’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio. On the downside, nuclear is expensive to build and insure, but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest. There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts. Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors (4th gen) which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run, making initial investment lower. They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid.",1.0
"So impressed Marko has made a video regarding energy use in the EU. It is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view, which is how companies plan on future availability.  Way to keep up the good work Marko! BTW - nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last 30 years and needs to come back. It is sad how German and French embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now. America should take heed.",1.0
"Excellent video, Marko! Things look really bad for now. Just recently it was reported that Germans (among many others, probably) already spend their savings to fight inflation (instead of having their salaries rise to cover it). I don't want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase, or when those savings run out.",0.0
"Great video again, Marko you did a great job 🙌

Sadly The Netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos 🤣
In addition I can tell that after the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 the EU banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second Chernobyl incident.
The thru regulations Coal was stamped as dirty and Gas was the second best option after Nuclear power.

If we go back into history the North European countries (the Netherlands also) build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages. Since there wasn't a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created. Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need.

From my point of view these things should change:
- Nuclear is the way to go
- Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants
- The western world shouldn't be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability.

Furthermore, the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0% intrest rates, the financial unstable countries (you call them PIGS) Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and with this structural inflation problems. Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time.

Last but not least, the EU but also the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE, start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years... if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable.

Thanks again Marko",2.0
"Hi Marko! I'm living in the Germany (not born though) and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis.  Honestly, as a european, I feel quite disappointed by everything. I understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after Fukushima accident, but on the other hand I cannot understand how they didn't invest in other resources, or should I say how the Europe, especially Germany didn't diversify when it comes to energy suppliers. It's like you said, they just ignored that fact, even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with Russia.",0.0

-Stock market is part of the Financial system which is composed of Lenders (corporations and households) and borrowers (households, businesses, governments)
-Financial system = a network of institutions, markets, and contracts that brings lenders and borrowers together 
-3 ways this happens: banks, bonds, stock market
-Banks deal with debt, stocks deal with equity (the difference between the value of assets/ interests and the cost of the liabilities of something owned)

"Great content in your channel, I’m 53 and my wife and I reached $1M net worth in 2017, five years later it’s $2.4M. Our yearly salary is a little over $100K. We drive older cars, cook at home, eat leftovers, and have 2 in college. We saved for college and our boys help by working. They will graduate debt free.",2.0
"Freeing your mind from consumerism is so important. We're literally trained from young to always want more, to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have. I was always a natural saver, but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others. It's still something I work on, but over time have gotten better. It definitely helped that I realized the image others put forward, the majority of the time is financed by debt! That's not something I'm interested in at all. I hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it. I'll definitely talk about it on my channel as well.",2.0

"Funny enough, the argument that Bitboy's business is ""advice"" is incredibly dangerous for him. Coming from someone who IS actually registered to give financial advice, there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice, and what you can say if that's your business. Needless to say Bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front. Normally, YouTubers are protected from liability because their business (YouTube) TECHNICALLY isn't advice-based. Admitting your business IS advice-based, though, might open you up to liability.

"Hey Erling. Paralegal here. I saw the end of your video, but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit. Lawsuits are not fun in any way (unless your the attorney/firm) and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress. My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always.

Moreover, if the other side has an attorney, they have the advantage of knowing how the system works, such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase (Rule 26a dislcosures, interrogatories, evidence you intend to use at trial, depositions of plaintiffs, defendants, and expert witnesses, etc.) and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge. 

I truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself. Just be careful with how you proceed. Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done. Also remember it's a legal system and not a justice system. 

This is not legal advice, just a concerned fan. Lawyers or other legal professionals, please correct anything I may have overlooked/unintentionally misconstrued. 

P.S. I think the service (the guy who threw the papers at you rudely) was fine, unfortunately. You identified yourself. Once that happens, they can just leave it at your doorstep.",0.0

"I< appreciate the content you put out on YouTube. I enjoy watching your videos.  I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you’re a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions. The good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market.

"I came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $460,000 in 4 months from $160k, somehow this video has helped shed light on some things, but I'm still confused, I'm a newbie and I'm open to ideas.",1.0
"I <,watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint.. Keep going. You've reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too"". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you can’t time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy.

"Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from  Feven Lena. I would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about..👌",2.0

"Thank you for your videos mate,its normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world. Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak.

"I< think the difference in this instance is that analyst’s are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATH’s. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out. Next bull run it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & i need this lower point to get back in, i've small cash on the sideline I don't like that but i refuse to fomo in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advise to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore.

"I <,have watched you for the past 2 years, and found you to be really down to earth and no frills. Congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins. Good luck. Bitcoin price recently completed a two-month surge that resulted in a price increase to over $25,000; consequently, investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency’s next target price. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you’re a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility.

For your info, Suppo. Syscoin has been there for a while.

These base layers will be kept for data availability (DA), to pave the way for their own L2s and , thus, infinite scalability. They are leading the way for modular blockchains.

"< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with *WTRADE INSPECTS* , in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.",1.0

We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.

"I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, I’ve small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mr.Kyle Miller. With his guides and the trade signal, I use in trading, I have moved from having 5.8 BTC to atop 17.3 BTC in a short period of time. Invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader. ͲeIєɠɾαm KyleMiller3 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his top-notch trade signal",2.0

"The daily BTC trading volume is already way higher than the total cap release amount of btc by GOX.  Also, not all coins will be release simultanious and there still is no hard date when it will happen. Plus, not every creditor will sell it instantaneously and everything most obviously.   

in short and in my humble opinion; The price effect will be a drop in the ocean and nothing to worry about for BTC holders, especially in the long run when more and more people learn that leaving your coins out of exchanges eventually lead to continuation of upward price movement (if S&D stay equal and macro eff into acount )",1.0

Do traders convert BTC into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and ""buy back"" by converting back into BTC? is this what people do? also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes? thank you for any advice, all the best, Kieron",2.0

"< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.

Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.

"Thanks<, for the update I always appreciate the insight. <I'm really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long, I had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video. <In as much I would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end. If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down, just like stocks are not done going down. And if this isn’t a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now. Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO. Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions.

"7:04 the Rubik’s 5x5 does the exact same thing, but it also has a lot of center twisting and lock-ups",1.0
"Nice collection. My cube collection is something like this:

So I started out with a rubik's speed 3x3 (when they were decent for beginners and not louder than an f1 car) but it didn't last very long (I corner cut too much and the entire thing exploded, and some of the pieces went missing)

Then for christmas I got a QiYi megaminx that I still haven't learned how to solve

Then my friend gave me a tiled rubik's 3x3. this was the cube that I leaned to solve on

Then I got a MoYu WeiLong WR (I'm getting an SCS Corner-Edge magnet set and a corner-core magnet set you can get from the cubicle). its a good cube. and until christmas it will probably be my main and depending it my stay as my main longer than that",1.0
You make the type of video I can watch over and over again. Love ❤️ the content. (I have watched this over 20 times),2.0
I don’t even cube I just watch these videos because they’re satisfying and I find it interesting how enthusiasts of different things talk.,2.0

"I watched it a trillion times in 0.25x speed but thank you, because of you I solved my very 1st rubics cube and I belive that if I practice thoroughly, I'll be able to solve without any issues. Thank you Bright side.",2.0
"Finally! I finished it and made it in one piece. The final stage was the hardest, I couldn't remember any move so I had to keep pausing the video and rely on the white color to not get lost since it's the only color that's the same with your rubik's cube on the process.",1.0
How to solve a Rubik’s cube in no time: *Leave it how it was bought*,1.0
"Finally! After 32 years, I was able to solve the Rubik's cube without cheating (peeling off the stickers). Thanks a lot for this guide!",2.0
Very well explained. It took 4hrs straight to keep solving it with all the algorithm in the video. Those trying to solve from this video keep practising the algorithm step by step and solve it,2.0
This was really helpful thank you 😊,2.0

Most people dream of having half your collection. I love the vids so much. Im getting a 5x5 today,2.0
"34:17 Do you see it? The big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers, the cloverleaves are actually the edges, and for the corners, half of them look like centers, and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle. This means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there, and that just makes it really hard.",0.0
Your collection has been growing so much year after year. It’s amazing.,2.0
This is a great review of what I missed when I stopped cubing for the past 8 years. I’m back at it now. Thank you for the video!,2.0
"I love octopuses

"It would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces. This is the reason why I prefer stickered cubes, the alternance between colors and black (kind of like shadows) make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3D aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself, which with a stickerless cube is just not possible, it just seems like one big cube. Do you know what I mean?

Edit: I guess what I wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which I don’t really like.",2.0
"What I find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100% sure that if you're buying a stickerless cube, it will turn at least half-decent, while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations, like the Original Rubik's series. Of course, you always look closely at what you're buying, but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about. :)",2.0

"I have always used stickerless cubes, from when I learned all through now.  One day a friend and I swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes (I like my cubes fast, he likes them slower).  His main was a stickered cube.

If you keep repeating the exact same steps on an unsolved cube it will come back to what it was before.

I was at a trampoline park and after I was done jumping I decided to play some arcade games. I won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there. It was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction. So I decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere mid-day with spectators around. Safe to say I could never get it back together. I ended up buying several speed cubes and I’m able to solve all of them.,0.0

That comes at the expense of having almost no corner-cutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn., but then again it's not meant to be their Speedcube (the Rubik's brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though, but for different reasons).",0.0

"How To Solve the Rubik's Cube FASTER ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmeleO65BHc

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING.

I try to reply often, but ""I don't get step X"" or ""it doesn't work"" is too unspecific and I can't help unless I know exactly what problem you have.


*MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES*
1:52 has the 4 moves, and you have to be able to do this to understand what ""4 moves"" means when I use it again later on.

*COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 1 & 2. If the side colors of the cross or first layer don't line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don't just pick white pieces randomly. I talk about this in the video, how I'm trying to match the other colors of the white piece (like white/orange etc.)

*TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER*
Step 3. At 5:33 I say ""you should already know how to do this"". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.

*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 5. There should be no problems here.
Step 6. If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 7. Finish the 4 moves (don't stop at 3) every time. Turn the bottom (don't rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.

""Why do I need to reassemble the cube?""
Randomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable. If you've ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces, then that can be the problem. If stickers have been switched, you will have to switch them back.

We should be doing everything possible to broaden chess's appeal, garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity, and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process.

That would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateur-like play.  This might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke, but I suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the NBA or NFL or MLB, some persons would be calling for an investigation.  Just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the Carlsen -Firouzja match.  (Note how strangely Carlsen played in game four, was it?, of his match with Pragg.)  I don't know how much Las Vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess, but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy.  In some ways, it was embarrassing to watch.  I don't believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess.",1.0
Everyone was so worried about him (Magnus) not taking it seriously. When he showed clearly it didn't matter how you look during a match. The board speaks for itself. TO MY FELLOW CHESS PLAYERS...PLAY THE BOARD NOT THE PERSON. Also If they didn't want anyone expressing they're facial expressions and such they would have made the tournament traditional and face to face.

Bishop: Can move in an X shape (can go for how long you want it to be), Can't jump over pieces. 

Rook: Can go in a + Shape (Can go for how long you want it to be), Can't jump over pieces. You can do a move called ""Castle"" if your Rook can reach the king and both pieces haven't move (don't know if that last part is right)

Queen: Can go in a + and X shape. Can't jump over pieces.

King: Can move 1 spaces around it (like a 3×3 Square), Protect this piece as best as you can (A checkmate will be an immediate lose). Can't jump over pieces.",1.0

King: can only move 1 time in any direction is known as the most Important piece but also the most useless 
Queen: can move as far as she wants in any direction as long as there's not a piece blocking her (small edit she is also known as the strongest piece on the board)
Pawn's: Pawns can move forwards 2 times on the first turn but only once after that on following turns and can only kill moving diagonally forward if the pawn reaches the opponents side of the board you can substitute it for any of your former pieces lost i.e if you lost the queen you could bring the queen back by getting a pawn to the opponents side

I have been a beginner for 30 yrs. I am professional beginner. Beginner Master. Expert in finding win for my opponent,1.0
"Believe it or not I’m getting a bit emotional watching this. I was fascinated by chess as a kid, but I was useless at it and got discouraged. My dad tried to teach me, but that mostly involved a lot of yelling, swearing, and tears. This is the first time I’ve seen someone explain the game with such clarity, enthusiasm, patience, and obvious love for the game. At 32, hopefully this is the beginning of a new chess journey for me. Thankyou so much.",2.0
Finally a video that has explained the concept of chess PROPERLY for beginners. I have tried to learn for years and could not find anyone who had the ability to explain this to me. Thank you so much GothamChess 🌞,2.0

"Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.

And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.

"So happy for Pragg!!! 😀😀😀 I was thinking ""push your pawns Pragg at the end game, please push your pawns!"" And when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances. Well done!",2.0
"Pragg continuing to be the comeback king!! Amazing play, he made this tournament extremely exciting, was just glued to all his games. And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely. He couldn't even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested. The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.",2.0

The great thing about him is that he became an International Master without even being a professional chess player. He worked in a bank, and in his free time or vacations he played tournaments.

Gotham teaches you how to understand broad, overarching concepts like a master. Daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master. And you teach us how to realize what master-level thinking even looks like. Seriously. I studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldn't advance past 1200.

I gained more in the 2 years since I watched those videos than I did in my previous 5+ years of serious chess study.",2.0

Maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video?  2) If you or opponent resign, a 30 second explanation of why it was ""resigns"" at the end would be awesome.  In this case, I saw your B on a5 was hanging and white's rook defending their e2 bishop.  But it's not always super easy for us to figure out.",2.0

In an esport I follow, (Age of Empires 2) one player (TheViper) was so dominant for so long that a streamer (T90Official) came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyone's identities were hidden and only revealed at the end. Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who. Was a really interesting concept, as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who. They've repeated the format 4 times now, which says something about how loved it is. But with chess being an online thing now, this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating.

"My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey. They played on the same team in inter-state tournaments. I found some of my Grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool. He won multiple chess championships (some amateur and some professional) in the late 40s and early 50s. He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines. He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year, it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa. My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially (chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then). Though, he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future. If a 13 year old made a multi-time champion quit the game entirely, he must have been truly special. My grandpa could card count so I don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge, and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career. I never got to meet him because he died before I was born (I’m only 23), I would’ve loved to ask him about Bobby. Maybe my mom knows a bit more. All I have are letters and a few chess trophies. It’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s.",2.0

Lashing out comes from difficulty communicating, feeling different and knowing you are different, it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight. Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess. While playing he probably felt safe, knowing the rules, knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didn't understand or care about.",0.0
"This story should also be a story of Boris Spassky. If the information is correct, the guy is a really decent person. Spassky could, repeat, could be a world champ without competing, but no.

It will run IOS 15, come in many colors, take great photos and videos, will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table, extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask, exquisitely play very special music and movies, and like the last 3 generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast 
It will be pure magic 🪄",2.0
I am ready for September 7! Hopefully iOS 16 and watchOS now will come out on Monday the 12th. That would be a good release date. I find it funny that iPadOS will be delayed a month. That is very strange. It seems like Apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like iPadOS 16.1 or 16.0.1.,2.0
"Was really hoping the airpods would have some sort of hearing loss/hearing aid abilities. There is a stigma (and $$$$ pricing on real hearing aids) whereas most ""headphones & phone"" combos have far more processing and programming abilities to the nerfed offerings from hearing aid manufacturers.

Schade das sie die Notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem Display verschwindet.
Ist doch eigentlich das Erkennungszeichen vom iPhone.
Ich glaube das sie das iPhone Mini alle paar Jahre, wieder aktualisiert, bringen werden.
Da ich erst letztes Jahr beim 13pro Max zugeschlagen habe wird es dieses Jahr wohl ein Update von meinem 2017er iPad Pro 10.5 werden.

"Mein Standpunkt, jedes Produkt ohne USB-C wird nicht gekauft. Beispielsweise hätte ich gerne Kopfhörer, die AirPods Pro sollen es werden, das Geld liegt bereit. Durch den Lightning-Anschluss wären sie schon vor dem Kauf veraltet und ein Fehlkauf. Das gleiche gilt auch für die iPhones. Das Ende anderer Anschlüsse ist durch die EU eingeleitet und steht fest.",1.0
"Das Highlight, (wenn es denn überhaupt kommt) dürfte die Apple Watch Pro werden (vor allem beim  Preis 😂🙈) oder die normale Apple Watch im kantigen Design. Das neue iPhone (ob nun groß oder klein) wirkt für mich persönlich, recht unspektakulär (Recycling IPhone Pro aus dem Vorjahr), gleiches gilt für die iPhone Pro-Modelle.  Ob nun Pille oder Notch ? Selbst wenn die Kamera jetzt noch „unbelievable“ wäre, würde mir das keine 1200 Euro, aus der Geldbörse locken. Ich denke, es wird auch das letzte iPhone, mit einem A-Chip überhaupt sein. Nächstes Jahr wird auch das iPhone auf den M-Chip umgestellt. Meiner Meinung nach, längst überfällig. Ich rechne noch fest mit neuen AirPods oder AirPods Pro. Interessant dürfte sein, was mit dem Apple TV passiert ? Auch mit der Überarbeitung des HomePod Mini rechne ich fest. Von einem neuen, alten „HomePod“, gehe ich derzeit nicht aus. Mich persönlich interessiert nur die neue Watch, da bei meine 4er, langsam der Akku schlapp macht und Apple nächstes Jahr, bei dem 4er Modell, den Software-Hahn endgültig zudrehen wird. Das wird vielen so gehen, da viele noch das 4er Modell haben und schon seit einem Jahr auf das kantige Design warten. Aber eins steht für mich auch ganz klar fest: Kein kantiges Design, keine neue Apple Watch ! Dann muss die 4er, bei mir noch ein Jahr, irgendwie weiter überleben. 🤷🏻‍♂️",1.0
"Vielleicht bekommt ja der Lightning Anschluss der Iphones ein ""Speed Update"" auf USB 3(.x). Das hatten sie auch im letzten Ipad Pro verbaut (allerdings damals ein langsamer USB 3 Chip der nur rund die doppelte USB 2 Geschwindigkeit konnte).

"Ich freue mich natürlich auf den Event und bin wie immer gespannt. Was ich aber mit meinem iPhone mache, weiß ich noch nicht. Ich bin mit dem 12'er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe über die vielen vorangegangenen Versionen und Käufe gelernt, dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iPhone meist genau dasselbe mache, wie mit dem vorherigen. Eigentlich sollte ich das 12Pro erst ersetzen, wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der Akku am Ende seines Lebens ist, beides trifft nicht zu. Vermutlich staune ich über das neue iPhone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf schöne neue Farben, aber dann nehme ich meins aus der Hülle und stelle fest, dass mein Oceam Blue auch nicht so übel ist. 😉 Zusammengefasst verspüre ich keinen Wunsch oder gar Drang, ein neues iPhone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem Happy. Vermutlich überspringe ich das 14'er auch noch, um dann beim 15er zuzuschlagen.",1.0

"Mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische Innere der iPhones. Beim MacBook Air M2 hat Apple beim kleinsten Speicher lediglich einen einzelnen Baustein verbaut und die Geräte sind deshalb angeblich langsam.

Und zum iPhone Mini:

I have an iPhone 11 pro that I'm completely happy with.  I'm STILL impressed by the cameras on it... beautiful pictures and video.  Is there ANY compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14?  Otherwise I'll wait until the 15 with USB-C.,2.0
I'll upgrade when they finally put USB-C on next year's iPhone.,2.0
"I feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part. I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well. 
I also see no reason for anyone to upgrade. I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers. I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way. If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line, I would say if you have an 11pro, any 12, or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade. IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything. Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time. 
The watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb. If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around $280-$340 brand or refurbished from apple. Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6. 
I think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip.
The product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad. Getting way better features. I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since it’ll have usb-c. I wish they would do the same with the iphone, airpods & apple pencil.

If you can find the M1 Air on sale, then it is still an outstanding value.

"It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz; not great, but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies. It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC 🤔? I feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), it’s more or less well-rounded. However, if I’m bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldn’t be that far off from the M1 Pro 14” MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” non-retina MacBook Pro 😅. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. I’m hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. It’s an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that I’ve yet to experience.

"2016-2019 was arguably Apple’s…not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software. For example, iOS 11 (2017) was pure trash. Control center for iOS 10 was…hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned MacBook, flat edge iPhone, apple silicone, etc. Apple is doing much better. Software is much better too. Not to mention, Apple is bringing back COLORS to their products. No more space gray, gold and silver. We have blue iPhones, red, green purple, sierra blue, midnight green, pink, so many beautiful colors. Red Apple Watch, blue Apple Watch, blue AirPods max, pink and green. Apple is so much (arguably) better now. Ive was good for his time but 2019 onward, we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better",2.0

I love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro. I feel like it’s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don’t preorder on launch day.

"It looks like they might be simplifying their phone line - by differentiating the Regular and Pro lines:
 - iPhone 14 / 14 Max - effectively last year's phones (same design, CPU, screen) will become budget phones at $600 - 700, replacing all the different old models (SE, Xr, 11, 12) they keep around to sell as budget phones
 - iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max -  will be the actual flagship phones at $1100 - 1300
Otherwise it does not make sense for Apple to downgrade the regular iPhone 14 so much.
Which is a good thing, because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models, sizes - now they'll just have regular 14 (effectively last years models) and 14 Pro (the flagship models). 
They should simplify the iPad line as well.",2.0

Interesting idea on body temperature.  If they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose, a feature to weigh you and blood pressure……you may never need your doctor. 😂

Not sure if I would want a larger watch.  I have the 41mm Series 7 and that looks “normal” on my wrist since I have small hands and wrist.  Anything bigger and I might as well strap a tablet to my wrist.

There always are trends to make devices bigger, then when that’s bulky, smaller returns.

But smart object and transposing the iPhone camera to get top-down shots... Those are game changers. Apple has gone a long way in terms of AI and I don't think anyone is catching up with this soon enough.

My only complaint with the Apple is battery life. If you use every useful feature Apple ecosystem provides you (Watch-Pods-Mac-Iphone), you're not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge. Once they fix it, my microscobic urge to return back to Android will be gone... forever. I don't need a foldable screen. I need battery. Apple has the rest of it.",1.0
"100% the most stable beta I’ve ever done on an apple product. Think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever. My biggest complaint is the UI for a lot of logins in safari. Not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right. I’m sure there is some kind of setting I can tweak, but LOVE the weather Lock Screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean! The layout of settings is a lot better also, even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything, but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”.",2.0

I was hoping it would just get the current iPad Air design, and that the iPad Air got closer to the pro with the full 11"" rather than the 10,9"". At this point they should just rename it iPad SE.

"I just bought an M1 12.9” iPad Pro BECAUSE I didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me, especially since waiting for M2 would force me to give up the student discount, which was a big deal. I know everyone wants the MagSafe charging or wireless charging, but I actually dislike wireless charging, so that’s unimportant to me, and the “performance gains” of the M2 don’t matter since it’s an iPad, it’s already crazy fast. 

Rumors I’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the M2 iPad Pro, because I use my iPad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode. A notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow. Imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side. Annoying! 

I’m very happy with my M1, and honestly, all the M2 leaks make me even more relieved I’m not waiting for it! It’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like.",0.0

"I've never understood why Apple does this. They send early-access devices to ""hand-picked"" channels that almost always give positive reviews. But, just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway, and the ""blacklisted"" channels upload tear-down videos or showcase major issues/negative things etc. I really wish Apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want.

From a consumer's point of view, I don't trust reviews from those who get the early access products. They clearly fit into Apple's agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place.

"At 8:18, does Lossless support in AirPods Prob2 mean the iPhone 14, etc. will support ANY wireless lossless audio hardware such as the NuraTrue Pro that was recently funded in Kickstarter? I sure hope so because Nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iPhones without support. That capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iPhones.

Btw, I really don’t think AirPods Pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming NuraTrue. Nuraphone’s specs are insane. I encourage people to go check them out and pre-order to save money. The Kickstarter is over, but I think they can still be pre-ordered. Nura’s Nuraphone (their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right!) is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release. The NT Pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an IEM, plus additional capabilities the Nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware. I use them daily. It’s an amazing audio brand from Australia. Great customer support too! Give them a try before you get AP Pro 2 — Nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them, so there’s no risk! You can also rent any Nura product long term and trade up every two years. Apple doesn’t do any of that, unfortunately.",2.0

I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip.

"I love this guy's videos and have been watching since 2018 but it's unfortunate how they focused on iPhone's strong points and left out some of Android's strong points as well. It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.

To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.
To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.

Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.

>> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other. This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely, and that is undeniable fact.",0.0
"I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing.
ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly.
So yeah, I think those are aspects that didn't get touched on much.",2.0
"When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup. My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types, it’s so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for. That being said, I still own an iPad that I use a lot, and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet.",2.0
I'm surprised by the environmental score going to Apple. Apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most Android phones.

The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that.

It’s smart to keep the always on display on the 14 series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to 10Hz (13 Series). 1 Hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard.

Additionally, Apple may be ""late to the party"" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it's going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I'd rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway.",2.0
I've always been with Android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. I doubt I will ever go back to Android now. This phone is absolutely amazing.

"I just transitioned to Apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years. I used to mock their features. And as I grow older and matured, I realized that solutions of Apple tends to be more on sustainable and long-term.

I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for “same design” practice, and I think, they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it. No wonder, there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphone/PC world. :)",2.0

Build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days.. I have a collection of broken Samsung phones for example, not dropped or miss treated, just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use.

There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they won’t put time into fixing.

"I am not convinced. I have done some digging into AI myself, genetic algorithms  and such. From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables, x, y, z, etc. It then changes part of the function, via constants to achieve the goal. If it doesn't match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements.

What I'm getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an AI and a basic algebraic function. Y = X would then technically be a sentient being by that definition.

Finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an AI the ability to feel pain, sorrow, longing, grief, greed, and the like is terribly inhumane.

A super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans.

One cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time. We sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldn't. As such, an A.I who doesn't understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical (even if it leads to suffering) in order to achieve an objective.

The most scary part it was, when we were chasing the fish (so my brother could shoot), we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface. It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help. It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one. From that day on i'm scared to go fishing. Not kidding.

"In 2005, Members of the Viennese art group Gelitin (including M. Puletta, Corroni Fali, Razzoli Caputo, and R. Calizone) finished erecting a massive, pink, stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out, on the side of the mountain. The final piece was 200 feet (about 60 metres) in length and 20 feet (6 metres) high on its sides. The group did not only expect people to observe the art work, but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top. The work, titled Hase (German for ""hare""), often called Pink Rabbit, first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025, though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016.

"This subject is one of my current greatest fears. With our current understanding, it seems likely that we'll either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isn't; or, on the other hand, make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it, perhaps for a very long time. The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me. True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe; but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance.... That's just fucking heart-breaking. There's something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it. It's like neglecting *the first* child.

The reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for *our* gain only, and only to use it as a tool. But, humans being expansionist by nature and training the A.I. on our own speech and texts, it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the A.I. slowly but surely. I hope the A.I. deems it ethically right to work along side it's creators and expand in co-op in the future when it does become senteint. Not only this but once the A.I. becomes self-aware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the A.I. and who gets to use it and for what. Because A.I. is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly.",0.0

There will be no doubt many sites caught in the crossfire. It's important to remember too that this is aimed across all of Google - not just for product review sites or niche sites. I feel that sites that focus on one topic/area of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point - but the guidelines although detailed in places, are still pretty vague. 

The data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully.",1.0
"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure ""helpful."" I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top. The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled.  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. 

Content farms have high production value and low value content, but users will go first for slick looking.  And the kicker, Google generates revenue from ads on those pages. Put simply, incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content.

I think that they still track you, and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it, and I believe this is also the case for other security features.

"A slightly lighthearted story, but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area (somewhere outside Sydney, Australia) and google maps told us to take a small backroad. It looked fine and it was paved and everything, and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route. Only our plans were thwarted, because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor, and it was moving really really slowly in front of us. We couldn’t turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other. We literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road, and it took about an hour.",1.0
My husband and I have relied on GPS to take us on long road trips. There have been several occasions where we would 'nope' out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the GPS.

I remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn. Freaky!,1.0
"I think it's safe to say that before trusting in systems like Google Maps, one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure, especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city. For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It's unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it's a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory. Like my husband's parents, they always have a large jug of water in their car, along with a week's worth of rations, First Aid Kit, blankets, flares, etc, even though they rarely go off the beaten path.",1.0
"Just a tip, if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway, or if you just not sure about the road, ask the locals.

I truly enjoyed getting to know Elon more.  Thank you for such a great talk.,2.0
"In my opinion, Elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future. It's encouraging, in a sometimes discouraging place to be. I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. 

I have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he... Just the fact that ""truth"" matters to him more than anything, shows that you can get onboard with his ideas, and plans for a better future for us all. Christina",2.0

Like if you need to be very organized in the job don’t say that as a weakness. Most people have several weaknesses, offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for (even if you’re saying it’s something you’ve overcome or you’re working on now). You don’t want to offer up a reason not to hire you. 

Also be sure to watch your facial expressions - you may be super passionate and or just  thinking 💭 but you don’t want to come off as angry or frowning (smile every once in a while haha)

"I was offered the position! I kept receiving rejection. I wasn’t sure if it was due to my lack of experience (career change) or my interviewing skills. I literally binged watched Richard’s videos, wrote down my answers, and PRACTICED. So thankful to have come across these videos 🙌🏽",2.0
"Hi Richard, just came to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. My husband and I were applying for new positions (I applied for a lead/managerial role, and my husband for a senior commercial/pricing). Both of us watched A LOT of your videos, took note of the answers, modified to suit us and practiced. We felt confident and equipped going into the interviews and we both got the jobs we wanted!! We are thankful to come across your videos. They are so helpful and thank you for all of your hard work in making such great contents.",2.0

"I recently decided to change paths and pursue a career when the lockdown was instigated. I studied for months, achieved everything I needed to, and started having my first formal Interviews. I failed 7 of them... with a little progress each time but it wasn't until I found this video that I have officially secured a job! Thank you very much. I used some of these answers in this video with slight variations in order to make the right impression. You are very good at what you do and have earned my subscription sir! I will be back for more advice in a couple of years as I plan to continue my studies and move my way up into a higher-paying position. Appreciate what you do! keep up the good work! :)",2.0
"Thank you, Richard for your interview tips. I participated in 3 interviews and I got all three, including my dream job. it's amazing how your tips are applied in real terms and successful",2.0
"THANK YOU RICHARD!
Thanks to your tips, templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience. The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language ( which I only use to speak to my family for many years now ) instead of english. So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!

To all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning. Good luck all!",2.0

"I know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce. They had been married for 25 years at the time of their divorce filing . I wanted to know why now… they both said if you see people getting divorced after 20 + years they’ve been miserable for the last 10 years.

Gary Owen said he’d rather be happy than be in a toxic relationship. I understand that… I pray his relationship with his kids is repaired.",0.0

My father wasn't really there, stepdad was so so but not the best father skills. And really had no other man in my life to get guidance from as a father. We do the best for our kids and that's all we can do.",1.0

As a person whom has experienced divorce myself I completely understand. When the feelings are gone...you on roommate level....it's run its course. I had to move on and find my own happiness.

"I change a little of what Rachel said, but here is the example answer provided by Rachel for the question ""Tell me about yourself"": I studied at the University of Florida and graduated in 2012 with a master’s degree in business administration. After graduation, I was hired at “happy kids creative” I’ve been there for the past 5 years and I’m currently the director of toy production. During that time sales have grown steadily. Its been a great experience but I run out of room to grow with “HKC” and I’m looking for new opportunities. I have a lot of experience leading teams in the creative process and founding new markets for the products that we create. 

-So just to get it: first she mentions her studies, then talks about work history. Mention an achievement (Sales have grown). Then she mentions why she is looking for a new job (out of room to grow). Then talks about her experience and strengths that she acquired (Leading teams) 

-Hope, that this can help people that like me, are trying to prepare for a job interview.",2.0

"I agree with this video however, it depends on your delivery. No employer wants to hire a robot….they want someone who has personality, relatability, and open mindedness. Therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself, I always include something personal that pertains to the job I’m applying for. It creates more of a human connection…and it’s always worked for me. 💯",2.0
"I've used this a few times and it works really well! My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers. Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions. The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didn't really work. Now I start by saying what I am doing currently, the job or education I did before this, a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experience/skills.  ""I am 26 years old, currently a team coordinator at ___. Before this I was studying __ and volunteering at ___. I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector!"" 
I don't know why but I always start with my age 😅

 I asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for, they told me someone who ""talks to everyone"". Lol

It seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where I remained relaxed but alert, and most important,  just be myself  .  If you are acting, it will tell on you and be unfavorable.  The person you are talking to is not God, just another person.  Keep that in mind during the interview process.  Always be respectful and honest.  I always enjoy listening to you Rachel no matter what you talk about because your diction is near perfect.",2.0

Your videos are just perfect.
P.s I heard that you used the prhase ""a little bit"", I had heard some natives that this is wrong, since ""little"" and ""bit"" means the same thing and it sounds like repetition.
I like to use it ""a little bit"". It sounds fun but some times I feel a little bit uncomfortable thinking if it is correct to use it or not, but if you use it here on a job interview, I know it is correct.😊",2.0

"Tell Me About Yourself - Job Interview
 -Mr. Davis is ready to interview now.
 - thank you
 -hello Mr Torrus, nice to meet you. 
 i'm tom Davis, the manager of LCI software. 
 -nice to meet you Mr Davis
-first i'd like to congratulate you on passing our aptitude test. 
you did very well. 
-thank you.
-so, how did you hear about this job?
-i saw an advertisement online. 
i clicked on it 
and it brought me to your company's website, 
where i applied for it.
-makes sense.
what do you know about our company so far?
-i've read on your website 
that for over 10 years LCI software has delivered professional services.
on software development projects for clients all over the world.
i can tell from the pictures and client testimonials on the website that you do great, 
quality work. 
-yes, we always try to do quality work. 
the software products we build help many brands transform their businesses.
So, tell me about yourself. 
-i completed a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Biology 
and a Master's Degree in Environmental informatics. 
i managed to get a job in the environmental engineering industry.
but i soon realized i wasn't cut out for that job 
and decided to move to a different industry.
i decided to take the path of a software developer.
-wow, what determined you to make such a bold career shift?
-i've had a great enthusiasm for technology since an early age.
i've always loved computers and gadgets and enjoyed building them and taking them apart.
i took online courses endorsed by high-profile universities and studied how to code. 
i have a few official software certificates.
i started by building websites for people i knew. 
it helped me build a portfolio of projects.
i got my first IOS development job at a software agency called tech services.
i had the opportunity to learn more about the software- building process there.
But, since there were not too many projects at that agency, 
after two years i decided to look for another job.
i soon started to work at an international startup company, Soft Solutions. 
it was a good chance to join a team. 
i've been able to use my training and experience fully at this company.
i gained experience in many things like teamwork, 
time management and quick decision making.
-how long have you been working for Soft Solutions?
-i've been working there for three years.
-why do you want to leave that job?
-i'm looking for a company where i can contribute more and grow. 
i'm ready to take the next step of my career.
-what exactly made you apply for this job at our company?
-i can see that your company has much future growth potential. 
i would love to grow my career at a company 
that has a great reputation in the software industry.
-what are your strengths? 
-my strengths are persistence and courage. 
i give my all to achieve my goals in spite of any hardships 
i might encounter along the way. 
i have a hard working nature. 
i'm always looking for ways to improve and grow. 
i'm also a great team player.
-can you provide an example of how you acted as a team player?
-i always tried to help my teammates complete their tasks if i had completed mine.
whenever someone needed to leave earlier, i would offer to cover for them. 
i'm willing to do whatever it takes for the team or company to succeed.
-great! 
so... what would you do if you didn't get on with someone on your team?
i would try to sort things out in a calm and rational manner. 
i would do my best to get on with that person for the sake of the team.
-what are your weaknesses? 
i can be a bit too straightforward at times and sometimes that hurts people.
but i'm working on this, and try to stop myself from being overly direct.
-where do you see yourself in five years?
-in five years, i'd like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in software development.  
i hope to be offered the opportunity to take the lead on some projects.
-there are definitely promotion opportunities at our company, 
depending on your achievements and expertise.
do you work well under pressure?
-usually i don't panic and manage to maintain self-control. 
there were many tight deadlines and stressful situations at my previous jobs.
i always put in extra hours and did my best in meeting the needs of the clients.
i've always delivered high quality work and respected my deadlines.
-interesting... 
can you tell me about a recent accomplishment or success you had?
i was part of the team that built the Louis kitchen app.
with this app, it's easy to order your favorites, even when you're on the go.
i love creating something that people can interact with and enjoy.
-that's quite impressive, i must admit.
okay, thanks so much for coming in, Mr Torrus. 
it was great to meet you. 
-it was great to meet you too.
-i'll give you a call tomorrow. 
-sounds good. i look forward to it. thank you.
-hello. 
-hello. this is Tom Davis the, manager of LCI software.
am i speaking to Mark Torrus? 
-yes, this is Mark Torres speaking.
-great. 
i'm calling to inform you that your interview was successful and i'd like to offer you the job.

"I just finished watching a documentary by a famous British historian about how people could possibly have been caught up in the Nazi regime. The documentary seemed relevant to this. This historian pointed out that each and every one of us likes to imagine that if we had been present at some dark moment in history, we would have been the ones to stand up, think independently and rebel. And yet, almost no one (if anyone at all) did this at these times. If you have grown up with everyone around you--parents, mentors, peers, teachers, leaders--all thinking one way, it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own. It seems that in a very significant way, we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born. Whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think, that is what you will be for the rest of your life. Unless you are one out of a million.

I was like..... surprised inside, but outside stayed calm because that's important. I get why they're asking, but I'm like, lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured? Who knows how I did. I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead. I'm in the USA if you didn't already guess that. 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up -- and no, they weren't security jobs. I don't even care, really.

"1. make yourself comfortable in the space before the interview (be present)

Being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts. Visualizing beforehand was mentioned, but it can be a total game changer. By visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview, your brain will be trained for that scenario.",2.0

I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely. I nailed it.

This dude lost the love of his life and it’s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her. But his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together. He knows that love is love. Says love sees no color, but then says race mixing is wrong lol I think his heart speaks the truth and then what’s been brainwashed comes out. That’s why he contradicts himself so much.",0.0

I love her accent....who else???,2.0
i could listen to her talk all day. even if it was just her reading the dictionary,2.0
"I love how she's confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how she's able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that. All of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and I really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well. So, good job. :)",2.0

"It's awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world. The hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going, disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life. And this is great, because this hatefull coments shows people's face, people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen, so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions. Thanks, Emma!",2.0
"I’m a guy, I listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums. I’m a right leaning guy politically as well. I loved this interview. I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation, exclude them. But Emma’s approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didn’t know they had. Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together, when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved. When I say compromise I don’t mean Women or Men not achieving full equality. I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side. When one person yells at another, the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back. Thank you Emma for being a voice of reason and compassion.",1.0

Semra is absolutely brilliant. She needs to be on regularly during transfer windows. You go girl!,2.0
"Hadn’t seen an interview with her before but what quality, insight and delivery. Excellent interview Stretford!",2.0
"Semra - I'm a long time Real Madrid fan and your analysis of Casmiro's game is probably the best I've heard in 10 years - both of his strenghts and the areas one might call 'weaknesses' - it was perfect, and I would add that both Zidane and Ancellotti held him in the same high regard - I hope we don't live to regret losing him too soon.  We need you on main stream TV more...",2.0
The channel has been getting some very good guests on recently. Well done folks.,2.0
"I agree with the Serma's comments regarding Casemiro's age, but this whole ""30 is the new 25"" is very subjective and depends on the player. Luckily, Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well, and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats. His injury record is phenomenal as well. However, not every player ages like Casemiro, Modric, Ronaldo, etc. Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30. So, whereas it's objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way, that doesn't mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it (some don't even have the opportunity to do so). Players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Busquets, are good examples of the counter-narrative in my opinion. On his goals, Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the opposition's box is very good - great aerial ability as well. All in all, Real should be glad that they didn't lose him without Tchouameni already recruited. Good luck Tank!",1.0
Semera is a gem! Spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her. Puts the English ones to shame,2.0
"Not only do we lack a DM, but we also lack a captain. Casemiro can fix so many of United's problems if he works out.",1.0

Haven't seen Elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while. Good job guys!,2.0
Great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for 3 hours. I enjoyed this,2.0
Can't believe Elon keeping a straight face and genuinely answering these questions. Elon is really down to earth person.,1.0
So patient with these guys. I love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand.,2.0
I love Elon's laugh. For someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious,2.0
"Watching this podcast I'm thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world. Then hearing Elon's response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is, and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance. No fake persona, no bs, nothing like any other billionaire. He is so ""normal"" that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today. Respect.",2.0
"Instantly classic. Love how Elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this... he genuinely cares about the state of humanity, more than money. GREAT WORK guys!",2.0
I don’t why but I have the sensation that Elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity. What a great guy,2.0
"This was the most interesting thing I've ever watched. Questions I have myself were asked and Elon responded in a way we can all understand, even though it wouldv'e been dumbed down x10000 in his books hahaha. True legend.",2.0

"I have always loved 50 interviews. He drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor. He's always had a blueprint, a map, a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes. He drops gems on life, business, goals, etc. He's a marketing genius. No one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining, while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman. Give this man his 🌹 roses while he's here, not after he's gone. He's one of my role models.",2.0
"That’s one of the best interviews I’ve seen recently in the hip hop space.

"50 is just a pivotal person who I repeatedly lock into throughout my life. He brings the knowledge, the hustle, the comedy, the motivation, the dominance, everything you need to hear to push further in your path",2.0
50 knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room. His aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledge/intelligence. All you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears. 🙏🏾,2.0
This is why the breakfast club is legendary. At any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview.,2.0
"This made me respect 50 even more. His business acumen is so on point. I love that he's helping schools in Houston. He comes off as the bully of the block, but he's Ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry. This man is constantly learning the business and taking over. Kudos and blessings to him.",2.0

"One thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for, I’ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life.

I also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker. Plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can I’ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself, they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by",2.0

"Himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate. He was detained for a short time, and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule, he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item, and during his autopsy, it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived. Some suspect that he was beaten to death. Historian and YouTuber “Mark Felton” researched this very subject about Himmler in a YouTube series called “The Death of Himmler” I cannot recommend his videos enough.

"As a Vietnam veteran with PTSD, I can honestly say, you have your moments - this is a mental illness. But depending on what you experienced in a war, it can bring back certain events. Ten years of therapy in 1999 denied you don't have PTSD, but now, VA says chronic PTSD; I grew it over the last 23 years. I was awarded PTSD this month.

My grandson joined the Army at age 31. He did not need to do that, skilled in plumbing and heating making about $40 per hour with 10-12 years of experience. But my influence as a US Army veteran of 13 years only. 18X training.",0.0

"I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.",0.0

However it's actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him. The reason being that now others (who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task) have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel.

After the conference in Tehran in 1943, it was decided that the Allies would start delivering aid to the Yugoslav partisans and that aid to the Yugoslav monarchists would be stopped. When, after the conference, one of the British members of the delegation told Churchill that he had sold Yugoslavia to the communists, Churchill asked him: ""will you live in Yugoslavia after the war?""

"My grandmother was born in 1944. She was the youngest of five children. The village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory, so the EAM/ELAS forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anti-communist activity. Her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply co-operate with the communists. Then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anti-communist activity. The whole family (my grandmother being just a few months old) was transported to a prison camp set up by the EAM/ELAS for anyone accused of opposing them. There, they rounded up all the men and executed them. My great-grandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well. Soon, the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes. My grandmother grew up without a father, something which still deeply affects her to this day.

"One small thing that perhaps was worth talking about: You don't mention the Percentages Agreement between Churchill and Stalin. This dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the Soviets and the British had over Greece in the post-war period, which defined Greece as chiefly British in influence.

"Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity. But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10,000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period. Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead, many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib. Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment. So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels. To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view.",0.0

I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites.

They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new ""Promised land"".  Thus the signs of Christ written with Hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate. There is another record which has been discovered in Panama much like the one discovered in Palmyra, New York. It is a gold set of plates with ancient Egyptian and Hebrew origins as well. Perhaps you could examin the Panama gold plates to see if they are authentic?",2.0

"So there's been some conversations here about my use of the term 'Viking' and who it refers to. I think it's important to start off by saying that these videos aren't made for university-level history buffs or the like. They're designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams (A-Levels, GCSEs etc.). Since I base my videos (where applicable) on British teaching standards I think it's important to note that that the use of the term 'Viking' and 'Scandinavian' are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level. At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree, absolutely not. That level of historical nuance isn't required here.

Yes, the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances. But not here. These videos aren't for in-depth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age.  The people commenting that 'Viking' was not used accurately are largely correct. However, in the context of who this video is for, it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities. These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further. There are other channels if you'd like in-depth and dry discussions of terminology.

Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed the video.",1.0

"I live in Volgograd(Stalingrad). All the veterans I saw said that this battle was a real hell.  when the asphalt is repaired or the pipeline is replaced, the remains of soldiers are still found in the ground, and 70 years have passed...",0.0
"My (Ukrainian) gran fought at Stalingrad on the Soviet side. She had to decode messages to be sent to headquarters in Moscow. Whilst in service, she personally witnessed the surrender of General von Paulus. She also told me that most of the prisoners she saw there were Romanians and Italians as opposed to Germans. God bless her soul: she left us back in 2017 and would be 100 next August.",1.0

"In Germany, right next to where I live (around 500m from my House) there is a small farm with a rather large Chapel next to it. 

The story behind that Chapel is, that the old Farmer who used to live there built it in order to keep a promise he made to God. He was in the battle of Stalingrad, survived, got captured and shipped to Siberia. While there he promised God, that if he made it out alive, he would erect a Chapel in His honor. 

He died around 15 years ago, very kind man and a good friend of my family. But you could tell that these experiences left their mark on him, as one of his main topics of conversation was always about food (where to get the best bread, who in our village made the best cake etc.).",1.0
The Germans really did hand the Soviets a beachhead fortress in this city. With all the bombed rubble it only became more of a nightmare to advance into.,0.0
"A couple of my distant German family members were at Stalingrad, and are still there as far as I know. None of the family know when or where they died exactly, but there are Oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial. I only learnt this while looking through family history, trying to learn more about my roots. They were barely in their 20's, conscripted and sent to fight. I'm now older than they were, and I couldn't imagine going through that sort of living hell. I understand they were on the 'wrong' side, and I absolutely respect the Russians for defending their homeland, but whenever I hear the word Stalingrad, it makes me think of those guys. War is a waste, so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power.",0.0
"Thank you for mentioning the real reason behind the 227 order. So many people think it was just a cruel note, allowing kgb monsters to shoot soldier at whim.

"My grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle, then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner, finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution. He never wanted to talk much about the war, only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival, I guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world. I remember the day I asked him about it, he didn't say anything, my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a Stalingrad.",0.0

"I've been a shortwave listener and Ham Radio operator many years. Number stations are a practical way of sending coded messages to agents throughout the world.  If an agent enters a foreign country, it's not hard to purchase a shortwave radio, set up a long  piece of wire and tune in a frequency at a pre-planned UTC time.

"Though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic, you can't deny that the definition of 'catastrophic' is different for everyone.

"Everyone's understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience. It is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables (which is practically impossible).

It's like electricity going out and you saying ""You think that's bad!?! Ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears!"". Of course that's a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now, and even though it may not have been important to them, to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it.

So please don't make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple.",0.0

So I pressed the radio button but it didn't seem to work because it was still Beethoven's 9th. After several minutes of punching that button, I discovered that it had worked perfectly!

"My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan (which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years) in the Guangdong Province. Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. 
Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children ""why do all of you not love China?!"" and they would retort ""if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?"" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.
I asked my Grandmother once ""do you think Mao Zedong is good?"" and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation ""Yes! Yes, he's wonderful!"" and started blurting out the first few phrases of the Chinese national anthem in song. I guess it's why that generation is called the ""Lost Generation.""",0.0

"Thutmose III was a child when his father, Thutmose II died in 1479 BC. His stepmother and aunt Hatshepsut became regent during his minority but was herself declared pharaoh within a couple of years. Although Thutmose III was not deposed, he would remain powerless during Hatshepsut's reign. In theory he and his stepmother were co-rulers, but in practice his position was nebulous and he was kept out of the way as Hatshepsut ruled Egypt. Thutmose III was also married to Hatshepsut's daughter to further consolidate his claim to the throne. Its believed that Thutmose III resented Hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first 22 years of his reign, and after Hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures.

Thutmose III was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunt's tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning. At this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory. All the while Egypt under Hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security, which the nation needed. Trade routes were re-established and the economy grew by leaps and bounds. This was the beginning of the wealth for which Egypt is now famous for.",1.0

"The Maritime Disaster that was the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 lives on in memory still in the 21st Century. How remarkable is that really? One of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of 1500 people. It must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark. One of the most eerie things I've ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck, a great distance from where they thought it would be, they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness, it was truly weird.

"As someone who studies convict leasing in Tennessee, this is a great video. Just a couple corrections:
1. Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham. They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (it's a little more complicated than that, but we can go with that for simplicity's sake) who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee. After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896, Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there, but those were Alabama prisoners, NOT Tennessee prisoners. 
2. States absolutely used convict leasing to make money. The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than $100,000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid-1880s. That would be over $2 million per year in today's money. 
3. Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers. The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner. They would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didn't know, and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses. Hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal.

"'The sorrows of young werther' is a fabulous book, despite the tragic-romantic style. It is not only based on Goethe's own disappointing experiences with women, but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him.
I'm no expert on Goethe but I also understand he completed the colour wheel which Isaac Newton started.
It is important to understand that in Goethe's time there was a 'Romantic movement'; nothing to do with the definition of the word today, but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment. Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called 'Sturm und Drang' (Storm and Stress), a small group including Schiller, of 'angry young men' who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement.
By the way, if you haven't done a video on the Romantic movement please do.
The Romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment, such as science and rationalism, and its clinical, dry, detached way of categorising humanity and the world.
The Romantics were not an organised group as such. One of the best descriptions of (the Romantics) was written by my old Philosophy teacher - ""The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of 'culture' and 'rationality' which barred the way, both historically and personally, to a ""return to nature"": this is nature the unbounded, wild and ever-changing, nature the sublime and powerful. Were humans to behave 'Naturally', freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality, then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed, and humans could live a nobler life. In the name of nature, the romantics worshipped: liberty, power, love, violence, imagination, irrationality, the Greeks, the 'primitives' or anything that aroused their emotional responses, while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves.""",1.0

• Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier
• The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett (another children's classic, yay!)

"i'm actually in an English major and English is not my first language (it's Spanish) and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if it's not your first language, at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words. Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors. Another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally, when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine.💗",2.0
"Though it is hinted, the video should have mentioned that Tolstoy was one of those few writers who was famous and received recognition in his own lifetime and not posthumously.",1.0
"Every time I watch your videos about philosophy, literature, psychology and sociology I am left with one very unsatisfying thought: there are so many books in the world that I want to read and don't feel like I will ever have the time to though I'm only in my early 20's.",0.0
"I think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself  in your ""death 
bed"" every now and then . To prepare yourself for this,  you must read 
the 9th chapter of "" The Death of Ivan Ilyich""  again. Just a very short
 chapter where Ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed.  He 
suddenly  hears the voice of his own soul saying:
-What do you want? What do you want?
He says:

-What do I want? To live and not to suffer.

So his inner voice says:

- To live? How?

- To live as I used to- well and pleasantly. 

- As you lived before, well and pleasantly?

Here is how Tolstoy continues:

"" And in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant
 life. But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant 
life now seemed at all what they had then seemed_ none of them except 
the first recollections of childhood. There , in childhood, there had 
been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live 
if it could return. But the child who had experienced that happiness 
existed no longer: it was like a reminiscence of somebody else. 
As soon as the period began which had produced the present Ivan Ilyich, 
all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned 
into something trivial and often nasty"".

So as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and 
darker.  He basically realises that his entire life had been a lie, he 
lived for what the others expected from him; for money, power and status...He wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no
 way back!

Indeed we all must keep Ivan Ilyich in mind every day. Just consider how
 fast the time goes by.... How much of it do we really spend seriously 
thinking about our lives? Very little indeed... Because it requires a 
certain level of focus and depth, which we don't have most of the time.
That's why this scene is a great reminder. 

So as we make the ""Death bed  exercise"" I have just mentioned, we can 
use the very questions that Ivan Ilyich's soul was asking him.
I think people who live well, deal with their mortality better. So doing
 this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better.

Thank you for this wonderful lesson. I love Tolstoy!",1.0

i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to STEM courses and careers. my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country, i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100% understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition, but luckily for me, my parents support me 100%. i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesn't have a lot of opportunities for writers too. but i know this is the path i want to take, o want to work with books, so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career, i would be happy for myself and my family. to those in a similar position as me, my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you, follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision <3 i don't regret my choice.",0.0

It's usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways. He was in many ways driven by his demons, and that can, surprisingly, take you very far in life, but it doesn't make you a better person. In fact, the success may militate against real change.",0.0

"Funny. I had an English undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days, while it took me weeks to finish the same book. I once asked him how he did it and he replied: ""Don't think too much. Just let the book take you away. If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading, that's when you'll read slowly and with a more analytical eye. But not every book will be worth it. And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it, so no point in forcing it.""
I kinda get it, because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it. At the end of the book I understood what it was about, even though I didn't get everything. But I just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything, and get everything right the first time.

"Seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely, we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us.  Most readers don't do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things they've read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them.  Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection.  And in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose, re-reading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same, if you pick it up again after a few years, you're a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way.",1.0

"I really liked what you said around 3:25 about analysis being in retrospect.
Recently I read The Iliad, a book that I had given up once before, and which I knew near to nothing about. I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a ""difficult book"", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a ""light reading"" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail.

"You are so right! The first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book, but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about. Not unless it's a drugstore romance, of course.
 I fell absolutely in love with Proust's writing. Luckily, I can read French and re-read my favorite passages in their original language. That's when all the light bulbs went on. I didn't realize it had as many plays on words in it. He has so many clues to the theme that you don't see in English. You just have to read things until you get them. And, like you, I would say that three readings is just about right. Thanks for another great video!",2.0

"These are really nice clips - even though I doubt I'm really your target demographic, having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores. I was particularly taken with your take (sorry) on Proust. I had a very similar experience with Thomas Mann's 'The Magic Mountain'. It took me three or four goes to get through it first time round, but every time I started from the beginning again, I was finding new stuff in it I hadn't noticed before - and in the end taught myself enough German to be able to tackle it in the original. Which was hugely worthwhile, and I still go back to it regularly.
Proust is also great, but there are large chunks of it I found really, physically, stifling and claustrophobic. But if you read anything about his life story, that makes perfect sense!",2.0

"Some of my favorite Voltaire quotes (this man was a genius!):

""Being a bird ain't all about flying and shitting from high places.""

""It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear. It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It takes an instant to kill him.""

""Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.""

""Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.""

""Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.""

""If you have two religions in your land, the two will cut each other’s throats; but if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace.""

""What can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying God rather than men, and that as a result he's certain he'll go to heaven if he cuts your throat?""

""Behind every successful man stands a surprised mother-in-law.""

 ""It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge.""

""Animals have these advantages over man: they never hear the clock strike, they die without any idea of death, they have no theologians to instruct them, their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies, their funerals cost them nothing, and no one starts lawsuits over their wills.""

""The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.""

""Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.""

""Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time.""

""Despite the enormous quantity of books, how few people read! And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day.""

""I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities, for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one’s very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?""

""Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.""

""The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.""

""It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.""

""God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh.""",1.0

"Tip: Always start with reviews, you can mix up their themes, maybe one review didnt do this but the other did.See whats been strongly estbalished thru time, and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic. From this, check recent (past five year-journals about these gaps and where do they stand. 

Also, literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to sci-hub, which can put you in a psychological rut. Not just to comfort you, but also as a professional tip— YOU DONT NEED TO WRITE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, OR EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TOPIC. Coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important, moreover sufficient. If you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 3-5 studies, try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph. You dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail, unless you see a clash between two papers, then maybe you can re-evaluate their differences in method.",1.0

The student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order. I find examples help, so students can see the limits and horizons before them.

"This was a lovely event, worth it for the acting alone, especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of Eve's awakening.

I do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeare's terms and turf, in part because Prof. Smith politely allowed it to stay there. Some thoughts:
- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.
- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.
- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.

In short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place.",2.0

He wrote for the ignorant barbarous ""ground- ling"" and for the intellectual as well. Milton actually says in the opening invocation of book 7 of Paradise Lost ""Still govern thou my song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few!"". He's pretty aware that he wont be liked by a great number of people but wants to ""soar above th' Aonian mount"" anyhow.",1.0

What's more, Achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the Iliad when Odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead, by saying that ""it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead.""

And he doesn't ""lie to everyone he knows."" His Cretan narratives are really important, non-violent defenses against a situation similar to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. ",0.0

"Magical realism is not from Colombia because the term is European in concoction. However, when European writers viewed the way Latin American writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of ""magical"". They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification, without realising that it's ALL real and that it's a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies. If we think about what exotification is, it's about seeing what's mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it. It's very much about ignorance and how what we don't understand can often appear magical. As a result, how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered. This is why magical realism, in my opinion, does not exist. It's a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre.",1.0

"Excellent explanation. I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes.

"Literature Review
Definition: A critical recap of what has already been researched on a topic

Why do a literature review?
1. To find out for yourself what's already known about the topic
2. To give your reader a critical overview of what you found
3. To find out what's missing (gaps)",1.0

Now what's due is my dissertation, for sure I'll be back.",2.0
Thank you for explaining what is literature review. I understand it very well.😊,2.0
"So, do you mean that we use the lit. review on primary sources? Or can you make your own lit. review after you finish your entire research? Cuz it also means justifying the methods used in a research.",1.0
Me actually pausing the video to go get a cup of warm tea xD,2.0
"As a student of literature, I fully agree with what you're saying in this video. I almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why I study literature lol 
I love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully, that's some real family goals right there",2.0
"Why I read and what book I read depends on my mood or my aims. Sometimes I read for a bit of escapism. Other times it’s to learn. Sometimes it’s both. I love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected, and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking.",2.0
"Emma, you have the best non-book channel book channel on YT!",2.0
"I think it's down to your mindset. There are some truly trash novels in existence, but you can read something like Normal People and take something away from it, like what your mum said about her crime novels. If you have a philosophical/analytical/learning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society.

A literature degree is a good place to ""learn to learn"" and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays, but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also.",1.0
"“I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.” 
This quote by Kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally. If we’re reading only for entertainment, where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with?",1.0
"I had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book, since it's been awhile- I haven't taken a English class this semester. But your thoughts made me remember. All the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience, question the beliefs/mindsets I currently have, and, well, to study literature!",2.0
"I read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me. Currently  reading a book on artists and architects. Since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries. So I got a book on the topic unfortunately it’s about 700 pages. Which almost put me off but out of pride I couldn’t give up. Only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people, are no longer there. So who do these objects serve? This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method. Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space. If I understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time.",1.0
"When you read a novel, how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author? For instance, one of my favorite books is The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov. If you read it by itself, it is such an interesting novel, however, learning the history of its writing in the background of Stalin's Russia makes it even more interesting. How much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners, if at all?",2.0
"I usually pick up a book for two reasons, either because I like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality (and that is why I read a lot of fantasy and horror) or because I want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time (for that is when I go to classics and more international literature). Also I totally agree with the ""people should read classics"" thing, it's so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations.",2.0

"Firstly, screening the literature is THE most important aspect of a systematic review, and for any other types. So,not teaching students how to use Ovid, Medline, Cochrane, tec. and only relying on PubMed is certainly the worst start up. You miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased, and therefore unreliable.",0.0

"Here is the Transcript.

The literature review is not an essay, it is not a research paper - the literature review is part of your essay, the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe stand-alone product if you're master's degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for. But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesn’t prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?

Well, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.

Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics  into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, it’s a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.

What’s the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again.  You see what I’m saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea.",0.0

"Greetings Mr. Taylor, I want to thank you for your tutorial on what a literature review is. My first paper as a doctoral student was rejected because I and several of my fellow classmates came into the program writing in the form of a narrative. Your pin-hole concept nailed it on the head. I used it throughout my Ed.S curriculum and can't wait to apply it to my candidacy cognates. Thank you so much.",2.0

"Verse 1]
9:05 in the evening, I'm all up in my feelings
I'm callin' your phone 'cos I can't get enough

My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Something I'll regret in the morning
But I just can't resist when you're calling

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

I'd move to the right, yeah, I'd do it for you, oh-oh

Now I need your love, yeah
Ooh, now I need your love
Now I need your love

Been way too long on the phone right now
What you sayin'? Wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cos
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
But I'd rather be in yours, yours (Oh)

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight (Oh-oh)

This song is so sweet in a sad way. It makes me think of when I was younger and Mom would bring me a cup of chai tea (she said the caffeine would help my head and my chest). Every bit of the lyrics seems like it’s about something special to my memories.

I was in the hospital a few months ago and I was so scared to go to sleep. I wish nobody had to be this sick when they’re still young, but it’s somehow a little bit comforting to listen to this. It’s all the thoughts I couldn’t put into words.

You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep

Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

"I think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after  being in a serious relationship.

You get yourself into situations with people you like, but couldn’t get serious with. Both playing a slight game with each other. You like each other. But don’t need each other. Both wanting to give each other late night calls. Sometimes resisting. 

You feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life, come home make yourself some food but come 8-9pm you often. realise you actually don’t wanna be alone that night again, and damn, you should have arranged something with someone. But now it’s maybe too late.",2.0

For those confused about the Pythagorean theorem, it’s the method used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a *right* triangle from the two side lengths. The formula is a^2 + b^2 = c^2

"Good summation. My only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in Jan 21 because it was highly shorted.
 My understanding is it's part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument (and all retail companies. Movie theatre, used game store, towels) and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket. I can't talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21. 
Sure, since becoming bagholders people think it's a movement but to start with it was a value play. When I went long gme was $9.18 pre split with $12 book value. When I went long bbby it was $4.98 with huge call option interest at $5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game.

I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck
And girl you know the deal, I gotta keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B.E.D., grinding slowly
I know you wanna love, but I just wanna fuck

You'll be coming back to me
Ay, you'll be coming back to me
Always worried 'bout them other hoes
And you'll be on me when the money throw
And they be looking out for Quees
And they be looking out for Quees

"Nice beds.  If you like the bed sheets to look crisp, like they were just ironed, make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets (including the pillowcases) with plain water, using a standard spray bottle.  This works on cotton sheets, which will stretch out as the mist of water dries out.  It is a luxury hotel trick.  The sheets will look pristine, especially white sheets.",2.0

I really appreciate how you talked about stress in this video, everything you said about it, your personal experience with it, how you deal with it/let it go, and especially all the little advices you gave us, stuff like this can be very helpful 😊.

I also really enjoyed all the triggers of course 😌, the iconic asking for consent about touching the viewer's face at the beginning, the stress pulling with the camera sometimes focusing on your hand and staying on it while it was moving back, which I tought looked really cool, the sound of the scissors snipping, the little sponge, everything, thank you as always Gibi 😀.",2.0

Hello Silke. Thank you for this. Lately I’ve been feeling a little depressed about working 60+ hours a week and not getting out on the boat all summer.

"Thank you! This session led me to a breakthrough in my perspective about people that prove not to be looking out for me. It's important to know who truly is for me, and walk away from those that are not. 
In fact, I had already walked away, but I had some residual negative thoughts/feelings about the situation. Now I can see how it actually prompted me to level up!
 Now I'm grateful everything worked out the way it did!  I'm in a better situation and I'm improving on a personal level. Silke, thank you for helping me let go of the negative energy! ❤️",2.0

The fact that the windows get darker progressively is a sign of how attentive to detail Latte is. Amazing work!,2.0
"Latte, would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your ASMR filming process? I am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are, how perfect you make them, and how you embody every aspect of the role you’re playing for these ASMR videos. It’s incredible! I’d love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming! I think many others would, too! 😍❤️🥰",2.0
"latte is so incredible. i am a teen and struggle with anxiety, depression, ocd, adhd, paranoia, body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, ptsd, and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain, so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep. i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life. she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending, annoying, or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality. i’ve watched all of her videos (including the ones in languages i don’t understand) and there wasn’t a single video i didn’t like. i love and appreciate latte so much <33",2.0
"The airline realness here is out of this world. The white china, the way the food is plated, the picture on the back wall.... It's just outstanding.",2.0
"I, and hopefully other people, would love to see a “behind the scene” of the making on of these videos!!!",2.0
"This woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice. Some asmrtists, as fine as they are, do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners. There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don't realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos. She just knows what's up.",0.0
Whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it INSTANTLY relaxes me. You are the only ASMR person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner. Your voice is just perfect for this....,2.0

"The version we did as kids where I live was honestly a bit weird. The direct translation would be: ""Three knives to the back, blood runs down, spiders crawling in your hair, snakes 'round your neck, crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down-"" and then you'd usually say ""boo"" or something. Maybe lightly push the person as you're saying it too. 
So yea, pretty hardcore for a bunch of 6 year olds lol",0.0
"Such a nostalgic thing for me. My mom used to help me sleep with these every other night. In my country we call them ""wierszyki-masażyki"", which roughly translates to massage poems ^^ Loved the video!",2.0

"Your RPs are out of this world amazing (I’m still vibing from the Trojan War medical muse/lyre player), but as this video shows, and as we all know, just “plain” Gibi (excuse the oxymoron) isn’t too bad either! (Excuse the understatement.) Thanks for the Zs. EDIT follows:

Actually I should not say Gibi’s role plays are “out of this world”. They are in this world. They portray pieces of who we are, or want to be, or pieces of people we know or want to know, or of people we have met or want to meet, or of friends (or personal assistants) we have or want to have. And this is (just one reason) why they are so amazing.",2.0

Sara James has a fantastic singing voice. Sarah did Rocket Man so much justice. The atmosphere she set with her voice was beautiful. She's an instant finalist. And only 14 years old which is mind blowing! I’m always apprehensive about winners being that young and having to deal with the pressure but I definitely see her winning. 🎤🚀🇵🇱,2.0
"Jestem dumny z Sary że pojechała do Ameryki i pokazała dwukrotnie, że potrafi śpiewać. Utwór z castingu i z finału normalnie czad! Jestem cholernie wzruszony tyle mogę powiedzieć... Wielkie brawa dla 14 letniej gwiazdy 👏👏👏👏👏👏",1.0

"Is There Anybody Out There?	lyrics
____________________________===========
 	I climb the rooftops every morning
And search for life there down below
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I send a signal for survivors
Requesting help on where to go
But there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

'Cause every time that I return to this place I once called home
Yes, every time the walls cry out, you're the last one - you're alone

Oh – is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh – is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

I wander streets that once were crowded
I'm searching houses that were homes
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I'm fighting off the dread that haunts me
But in my empty heart it grows
'Cause there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

And every time I raise my head, panic stares me in my face
Yes, every time I try to think, I get trapped inside a maze

Oh – is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh – is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

Oh – is there anybody out there?

"POT FARMER DANCE SONG $$
I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot
You better believe it held a whole lot.
I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame
Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.

I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes
They did nothing but give me regrets.
My mom had arthritis could not walk around
I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack
 After I smoked some to me it came back.
Soon I decided prices were high
I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.

I bargained for seeds from smokers all around
 Got in my truck and drove out of town.
I walked through the woods where wild birds nest
 Found me the meadow I thought was the best.

I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds
Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds.
I watered at night with a five-gallon pail
 Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.

Seven months went by; I thought I would die
Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky.
At night I went out, in a camouflage suit
 Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.

I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found.
Came back and got it, when it had turned brown.
I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags
Called all my friends and passed out free drags.

In less than a week my crop was gone
 I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

It turned out that I had a very similar experience with the Chinese lady in this video as well. My parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal I could ever have wanted. I also requested this when I was sick and also when I got braces on (because I could only eat soft foods). It really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is.",2.0

I can eat them by kilograms!",2.0
"I don't know why everyone is disliking the British one, for me I think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether you're happy, sad, tired exhausted or energetic.

"Being British the best comfort food is at Chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are PERFECT they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage (and if  you like it the bone marrow) it’s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

A fellow Mexican here and I have two different comfort foods. For when I want something sweet I go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means it's good for literally any time of the year.

My recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if you're not big on seafood.",2.0

It holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits I love.

Nikhil had so much energy and was actually trying the food. Makes me want to travel to India just for the McD's food.,2.0
I love that basically everything has a vegetarian option in India. I’m kind of jealous.,2.0
"The thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two Mcdonalds in India. North and East zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by Hardcastle foods. The menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives.. I think Nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds. They have a bigger menu compared to North and East.

Indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold 100% of business in India. They are required to partner up with a local company.
so,
McDonalds partners with connaught foods and Hardcastle foods
Dominos with jubilant foods
Yum brands partner with Devyani International, Sapphire Foods and more recently Burman Hospitality
Starbucks with TATA coffees. 
etc.

so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in India",1.0
what nikhil says from 23:00 is absolutely right. it might seem it's cheap to the foreign viewers. but in reality it is actually quite expensive for the indian population.,1.0

They were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at Domino's. These teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student, the twisties helped me a lot!",2.0
"I love how brutal the commentary is in this one. It's about time somebody puts Dominos in its place. I never really understood why people like them so much, but to each their own, I guess. It's just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for.

"Domino's India have deteriorated a lot over the years, their cheese burst doesn't burst anymore, stuffed garlic bread doesn't have cheese in it, and most importantly they don't use ""cheese"" anymore, it's all veg-oil based cheese substitute. Even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before. I used to love Domino's before but now it's a nightmare.",0.0
"I've been living in India for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the Western menu. I still remember my first year in India seeing a big domino's ad where they'd advertise two new pizzas with 'exotic' vegetables, the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini. goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective ;)",2.0
"FYI,we also have Garlic Breadsticks, Stuffed Garlic Bread,Cheese Dominator(1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza),5 cheese pizza(1 out of those 4 cheeses is a Ghost Pepper flavoured cheese),Paratha Pizza,Red Velvet Lava Cake and Butterscotch Mousse Cake,which is the most heavenly thing available on the whole Domino's menu but it's also true that these items are region specific that's why it is there in Kolkata,West Bengal but not in Bangalore",2.0

"When I lived in Japan about 17 years ago, MacDonald's had a burger called the McGrand. It had a creamy Dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce, tomatoes, and so on. It was so good that I still think about it occasionally. I was really disappointed when I moved back to Canada and it wasn't on the menu here.",2.0
"The Japanese packaging is cute. I’m also surprised Mcfloats aren’t a thing here. But the ice cream machines are always down, so maybe that’s a factor.",2.0

Oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good.",2.0

"Funny to see a Teriakyi burger. I can't have tomatoes due to GERD and other issues, so I tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with. 
I tried Teriyaki on my homemade hamburger, and it was a great alternative. Funny enough, Japan's Mcdonalds does the same thing, lool. 
My at home one was fantastic, so I have no doubt they love it :)",2.0
The japanese sauce-packaging is awesome! This is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen at McDonald's,2.0
"A number of years ago McD did a limited ""Global Menu"" thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the US. I think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that I remember was a burger from Spain and a Stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands. I don't remember trying the Spanish burger, it really wasn't anything that different. The Stroopwafel McFlurry was awesome tho, was sad to see it go. Anyway, I knew a little bit about the Japanese exclusive items, and was hopeful they'd continue it and do a run with a few of those here, the McTeriyaki Burger sounds awesome, and I'm surprised they haven't tried the McFloats here. Ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the US and it would be so easy. A Dr Pepper McFloat would be really good for US taste. I'm also kind of upset they ditched the Snack Wraps, probably a US exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around. They had 3 that I remember, Big Mac, a barbecue crispy chicken one, and I think a bacon ranch one (?) wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito. I think you got 2 per order, and They were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if that's what one was hungry for on the go.",2.0

Yummy street food! I like those foods. 😍😋,2.0
"For those who don't know, KF Seetoh is a legendary street food critic in Singapore. He has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture, and guided the likes of Anthony Bourdain etc through his long career. I also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other Singaporean food influencers do. He really cares 100% about the food.

Edited for grammar",2.0
Incredible job on that video! He is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry. I think you found the right man to introduce Singapore hawker food. I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty ✋🏻 Travels 🤝🏻 Premium.,2.0
"This gentleman, Seetoh made this video a DELIGHT.  Usually I watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods. This man had amazing knowledge of EXPRESSLY Singaporian dishes....and it was extraordinary.  Thank You!",2.0
Love the fact that he's able to give us the history behind all the Singapore favorites. He was also a friend of Anthony Bourdain if you Bourdain fans may recall.,2.0
Such a joy to watch KF Seetoh. His passion for the local food scene. The way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners. Couldn't stop smiling the entire video. 29:48 was touching. Love the guy❤️❤️,2.0
"Glad that Mark chose to work with SeeToh, someone who has lived the 70s/80s, someone who has tasted and knows how authentic Singapore Street/Hawker Food in the 70s/80s were like, and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that era.......things that young people wouldn't know.",2.0
"As a Singaporean I'm so glad to see KF Seetoh introduce all the food in less well-known (not the chinatown complex, hong lim or golden mile) hawker centres that's locally loved!",2.0

I don't think I've ever seen such a stark difference in selection and quality on a Food Wars ep before lol,1.0

For ppl who live in the U.S and want to experience the Asia 7-11s, go to Hawaii. 7-11s are run by different companies in Asia which explains the significant difference. As an American, I barely go to 7-11 except if I need a drink. Food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk, high or don't care",0.0

The mashup of different pop all mixed together is called “swamp water.” Long time ago it was specifically Coke and orange pop but has transformed to refer to basically a mix of different pops of random assortment. It actually works well and is a go to for when I want something fun and youthful.,2.0

"Mark, you are the reason I will be putting Spain as a place to visit and eat at after this amazing food tour you have done this far. Every place you have showed us on your tour looks just absolutely amazing and stunning. The ambiance and the energy of these chefs is just outstanding. Also the quality of the ingredients and the recipes they have shared with you is just mouth watering. Spain is now on my bucket list thank you for showing your experience there. I am excited to see what is next!",2.0
"Gabriella: “San Sebastien is obsessed with raw ingredients and how they prepare them”, spot on! Food seems so simple when you look at it that way...but so few do.
Gabriella has been another perfect foil on your Spanish tour - these outstanding people you've worked with across Spain have taken everything to a genuinely jaw-dropping level. I love the format – working with people who are as passionate about food as you – and they simply take you to their favourite food spots - genius. I'm totally loving Merrihue being with you now...I'll feel rather sad the next time he's not by your side in a video! Loving your work, Mark.",2.0
"What I Love about Italy & Spain is the simplicity of preparing their food, allowing the natural taste of the food to shine through. In America we overcook, over prepare our food! The freshness of this food makes you feel like you never had true prepared food. Mark, this is what sharing food is really about! In your own words ""Wow!!! Can't help but to appreciate you & your show!",2.0

Don’t go cable, network or public television…just keep doing what you do!",2.0
I'm so glad to see reviews on food from Spain. I never knew anything about Spanish food 'besides for western world Spanish food  like Mexico  to Brazil. I never was even interested i looking at Spain as a food destination and now its definitely on my food bucket list .

"I ate here as a kid before, during, and after the filming of this episode. My dad is vegan so we went here often. The food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with, he was always super nice. You could imagine my surprise when I got older and saw this episode lol. I never saw Gordon Ramsay but I saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast. The potato pancake was my favorite on the menu! It's a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists.",2.0
This man is a very gentle soul. It's hard for him to get angry,2.0
"this is a really good episode, lots of great moments. the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself, the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed, the owner eating the plants straight from the pot... a fun time",2.0
"So wonderful to see that guy love his Dad so much that he wasn't even disturbed with his Dad yelling at him, recognised that it was apart of his Dad's growth as a manager, and got so excited by it happening!",2.0
"The owner in this episode is such a sweetheart, bless his heart. It's sad that some of his staff take advantage of that. I'm so glad Gordon came to help and I hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear.  I really hope that after Gordon leaves that Dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves. To be completely honest, the cook showed promise, but he didn't show up half of the time when he needed to and didn't listen to Dean and wants to say Dean is a bad man...that's ridiculous. Dean put up with Orelio (cook/chef) thinking he can do what he wants (mainly Dean's own fault) and so now that is what he expects. I would have fired his ass a long time ago.",1.0
The son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful. I really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well.,2.0
I would literally eat here the owner was so respectful. You could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant. He's definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well.,2.0
"The owner is so down to earth, humble and nice. If this is my Boss I would literally work longer in that restaurant.",2.0

Chef John always coming through with the best stoner food.,2.0
"I'm going to comment this on every potato video:  To simplify the de-starching of your potato, whether it's for chips, fries, hash browns, or whatever, use a solid-bottom salad spinner.  Fill it with water, swish your potato pieces, lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until it's clear.  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes.  You will get them super dry in just a minute.  Then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel, but this will save you paper towels, because they will be dry.
Of course, there is no reason you _must_ use my technique.  After all, you are the Johnny Depp, of your Potato Prep.  Enjoy!",1.0
"I have been coming back Chef John's recipes then and again for years. There's always great nuggets of advice (and reasons to chuckle) in these videos. Thank you once again, Chef!",2.0
"I’m allergic to sunflower seeds and most store-bought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil, so this opens up my life to potato chips! Thank you, Chef John!",2.0
"The only problem is avoiding eating the first batch while the second cooks. I place my chips on parchment without the dinner plate. I also toss them in oil without rinsing them. My 1100w microwave takes 3 minutes per batch. Also, you can get a variance of 50% with the time required depending on the potato itself. Always keep an eye on it and never assume the time will be the same.",1.0
"Chef John - from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave, the man does it all!",2.0
"I had to come back to say this works great! I used olive oil spray though and Lawry's season salt, but same result. Very crunchy. Only 6 minutes in my micro, so as Chef John said, watch them because everyone's micro is different.
Also, kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round. But I think I did one too many folds because I ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together.  😁",2.0
These look amazing ☺️. I hate the fact that store bought crisps (I'm watching from the UK) or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling I guess. Thanks for sharing,2.0
for years now I have had this overwhelming frustration when watching Chef John's videos...i just wanna give em more than one thumbs up.  such a legend,1.0

"Philipino cuisine is criminally under-rated! I’m Mexican American from So. California and believe it or not, I went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt’s filipina coworkers. Wasn’t until I started dating a half Filipina half white girl I first got to try it at a legit restaurant. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING! My family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when I realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment I felt like I found my long lost relatives haha! That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal… HALO-HALO!… Are you kidding me filipinos!? That is crack cocaine in dessert form! And everything else! All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro! 

I love my Mexican food and while I wouldn’t ever trade it for anything, filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion.",2.0

"That movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called “butter salt” (brand name Flavicol).  The compounds that give butter it’s buttery taste can be made artificially (or extracted from actual butter), then mixed with salt as a powder.  This is then mixed with oil, and that’s what movie theaters use.  You should dry age with the pure Flavicol powder — I bet that’d be incredible",2.0
"Has anyone mentioned that this BBQ sauce looks fantastic? 
Will you tell us how you made it Guga?",2.0
Hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and let's see if it will work and will taste much better ☺️,2.0
"Popcorn oil is amazing. 

I used to work at a movie theater and we’d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper. One day I added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing. Perfect golden color, savory, delicious. People complimented how good the popcorn was. I became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn. One day I showed a co-worker my secret and he thought, “if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1, then 6 must be amazing!” We received so many complaints over his oily popcorn. Had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags. The lesson: a little oil goes a long way, don’t overdo it with that stuff 😆",2.0
"The juxtaposition between Angel and Leo's reactions is hilarious.
Leo: The juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier, it's a little bit more savory, it's a little bit rich, whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience, I love this.
Angel: The second one had a *urgh* , you know like it's like *Urgh* , it's like *URGH* , you know it's like *UURRGH*",2.0

"In WW2, when the Americans liberated the concentration camp ""Saint-Cyprien"", located in France. The American troops wanted to feed the newly freed Camp Prisoners because they have been starving. 

Without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food, literally seconds after liberating them. The soldiers, thinking it was the right thing, started giving the Prisoners Apples, Sandwiches, and even Chocolates. 
Leading to a lot of Prisoners dying.

After that incident, the Science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the Medical Staff feed them first.
It was mostly a slow input of light soup.",0.0
The fact that Jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes. He's really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people.,2.0
There’s a story on YouTube about a crew of Japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food. They were eventually rescued by an American ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate. Making sure they only ate small amounts of soup. Ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation. And it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost.,0.0

"My grandmother told me this story: We're from the Philippines, and during the end of WWII during and at the exit of the Japanese occupation, the US military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food. One of my grandmother's neighbors, a young boy, picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies. He dropped dead moments after. At the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death, but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome.",0.0
I just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa I appreciate you Mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,2.0
"Slight correction: Pretty sure Gordan didn't know MrBeast was fasting until he literally started cooking for him. He probably would not have even started cooking if he knew. By the time he started, he definitely has the pride of a chef to have his target audience enjoy his food.",1.0
"13:15 just a quick correction there. Jimmy did do it for the content, but he stated in the comments it was also because he has Crohns disease, which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation. He wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation.",0.0
"I was in a pretty bad accident when I was younger, spent about 3 weeks in ICU hooked up to a nutrients IV and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed. I still remember the first time I tried to eat solid food after that. It was a little microwave Kraft Dinner cup. I took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed. I haven't really been able to eat plain KD since then :/",0.0
"This is probably my favourite food theory video to date. This information could save lives of people who fast, whether voluntarily or not. As someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food, I really appreciate this information. There had been times in which I went a few days without food, only to try and stuff myself. I only ever felt sick, and knowing it's my body's natural response is a huge perspective change.",2.0

"Looks great!  The bakery where I work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins - for dairy we use sour cream rather than milk/buttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla, but otherwise very similar!  Someone has maybe already commented this, but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup (for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect) of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking.  Blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo!",2.0
You can try coating the berries with flour before you mix them in. The flour coating on them slows down how fast they fall to the bottom of the pan. The same goes for things like chocolate chips.,1.0
"It's a common trick in a lot of baking circles, to toss the fresh fruit with a little bit of flour, before stirring in the fruit to your baked item. So for a pound of blueberries, perhaps toss them together with about two tablespoons of flour, which should keep them suspended in the batter as it bakes.",1.0
"I’m upset about other things in my life, and I’m still confident that I would love these (and not complain about blueberry placement)",2.0
"Perfect timing! We have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer, tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks, can't wait to try this recipe!",2.0
This looks so delicious! Can't wait to try it!,2.0
I've heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter.,2.0
"I call the sweet style cornbread ""breakfast cornbread"" cause when it's paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast. I'm gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch.",2.0
"Looks delicious!  I've got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake, and I add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter that's already in the pan to keep them suspended in-cake.  That being said, I also love cobbler so I don't have a problem with Blue Bottom cornbread either!",2.0

It's really interesting that you said that placenta's texture is very mushroom-like because there's a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms.

"Okay, this gonna be a long one, sorry about that.

I'm French, and there's an interesting fact about France, it's that we are brutally honest. Most other people don't like that, so we are called arrogant, rude, obnoxious, but we are not, we are just honest, and people don't like honesty. When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other, it's not because we cheat more than you, it's just because we honestly answered the questions. You're probably wondering where I'm going with that.

Well, I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other, not staying friends with each other, yada-yada-yada, and I can't relate. At all. Because it doesn't work like that here. I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School (and I'm 40), whenever I see my mother, or my Girlfriend, or my Girl Friends, they are just friendly.

I dunno, it's probably only on screen, but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly, then as soon as one leave, they all turn to bitch on this one; that's something I never saw in France. They bitch on her while she is here, and she doesn't take it badly, because she does the same.

So I was wondering, why is that ? Why are they still friends if it's different for others, then I realized, because we are honest.

My female friends won't hesitate to look at each others and say ""Wow girl, you look like shit today"" ""Didn't you put on weight recently? Maybe you should work out"" and for me, that's a healthy relationship.

Why does American males manage to stay friends ? Because they trash talk each other, because they are honest, because they say things as they are. Yeah, sometimes we have fallouts, but we mend things,.

Why can't female American stay friends ? Because they are sneaky, they lie, ""Ooooh, you look gorgeous girl"", ""You are so strong, I envy you"", while not thinking any of that. Sooner or later, in any relationship based on lie, the truth will come out, and it's not going to be pretty.",0.0

This one also looks promising because the directors are same and Hrithik looks fine as always.

theme is where the raja is haunted by the ghost and it tells raja one story and asks questions at the end of each story. And based on the answer the ghost will take action.

"A lot of people are missing the reason why Hrithik went in different direction to Vedha's character than Sethupathi's calm & composed. 

Vikram Vedha is based on old Indian folk tale/mythology of Vikram-Betaal(Baital) from Baital-Pachisi. Betaal is described as a creature/monster who questions king Vikramaditya's strong sense of justice. Betaal is little bit crazy, and inhuman (addressing Achara's concern), and that's the vibe I'm getting from Hrithik's Vedha's unlike Sethupathi. They are going more traditional route, and Hrithik didn't copy Amitabh's character from Agneepath, either. 

Honestly, I like the approach original creators and Hrithik took for this one.",1.0

LMAO I don’t think y’all are understanding Junho’s character. Minwoo is his roommate. That is all. He’s keeping whale talk with Youngwoo to only lunchtime because he wants to get to know her.

"Junho and MinWoo are room-mates, that's why you saw him in the mirror when Junho was brushing his teeth. And at the end her father kept repeating the fact that she got him sushi to point out how ironic it was that his daughter went to a high-end restaurant but got him sushi (which is the japanese version of Gimpap, which is literally what he sells and what he made her for breakfast). It's ironic cuz if it were anybody else who went to an expensive restaurant, they would have brought back something that he usually wouldn't eat, not sushi. And in the car, the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to Young Woo about whales entirely, which is not what he did. He didn't listen to her cuz he doesn't find it annoying. The reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldn't call him while he's in the bathroom or if he's busy. Also, you could see he was disappointed when she said she has nothing else to say to him, and that's because he wants her to be curious about him but she isn't. So he already likes her.",1.0

"By the way if this hasn’t commented yet all the cases in the episode happened in real life or real cases. The was a lawyer who wrote essay about his cases, they bought the copyright from him, and hire him as their consultant as a lawyer to have the perfective of an attorney. This episode focus about being independent from your parent especially going into marriage, remember at the beginning Young Woo’s father wish that someday her daughter will get married because it all father’s dream to walk their daughter into the aisle and at the end of the episode YW said that if she will get married someday she will not throw the bouquet instead hand it to him so that he can get married since he never have a change to have one and just take care of her which is just the sweetest thought a daughter saying to a single parent so that he will not be lonely. Then our bride finally have the guts to be free from her father’s grasped because he is controlling her so much that she doesn’t have the say if she is arranged to be married. 
Lastly JunHo and Min Woo are friends and flatmates they are not gays😂🤣 anyway you will find out in the coming episodes.",1.0

It's like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients.

"This movie's actually a play on the 1940s ""film noir"" style of filmmaking,  movie's like _The Maltese Falcon,_ _The Big Sleep,_ or later on stuff like _Chinatown_ about a jaded detective  starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when you've got it all figured out, a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light.

So basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the ""detective"" was an aging hippy with no sense of self-motivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it. 

At the time it came out, people compared it to their previous film _Fargo,_ which while it had distinctly Minnesotan humor it was still a serious ""true""-crime story in the end. But comparison _The Big Lebowski_ is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story that's ""about nothing"", and people didn't like it. 
It became what's known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance.",1.0

Re Mav's F-18 being unable to fly again after his 'demo', pulling Gs damages the structure of aircraft. Too many Gs will break the airframe immediately, but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage: microscopic cracks that build up over time, invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks, sometimes during normal non-extreme flying. To combat this, all aircraft have a rated 'G-life', that is the maximum cumulative number of Gs they can pull in their lives before they're retired as a precautionary measure. Mav's extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his F-18 immediately, but they may have used up so much of it's G-life that it's effectively scrap anyway.",0.0

"30:54 The numbers on the screen that were climbing was G-Force (G stands for gravity). 2 G's is 2x gravity. 7 G's is 7x gravity, etc. He pulled over 10 G's which means at that one particular moment he weighed 10x his body weight. The same goes for the aircraft. What he was saying to maverick was that he ""put so much stress on the aircraft that it bent the frame itself"" making it un-airworthy since you would have to replace everything anyway.",1.0

"My theory here:

- That ""plant creature"" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the ""Missing Persons"" and  ""Autopsy Report"" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the ""Informational"" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the ""Presentation"" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of ""9780415263573"", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out ""Help"" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the ""original found footage"" video and later the ""Pitfalls"" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol.",0.0

If you look closely at the entrance she came from, it widens!
So I think that the backrooms was making a new nest for the ""entity"".
But since the rooms entrance got so wide, the ""entity"" was given a chance to capture her.
Also you hear it's roar before it cuts...

Edit:just figured out that human blood causes the bacteria on bodies to grow.

"No sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular! I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life. The sound of the jets flying by, the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in, and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots. I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die, so few movies today make me believe that!

On top of all that, the story is so freaking amazing. The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones, the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly”. And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman. Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance.😭😭😭😭

"Fun fact: The reason why the F-35 fighter that Maverick mentions when he's briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the GPS jamming.

In actuality behind the scenes, the F-35 didn't have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the F-18s. They needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the F-35 couldn't accommodate that",0.0

"Daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in Fire and Blood. The “Heir For A Day” brothel scene really makes me question him. We saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all, despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the Gold Cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys. Mysaria seems to be an enabling force, goading him into his darker tendencies. When he says “we must all grieve in our own ways”, I think he actually was somewhat saddened by Baelon’s and Aemma’s death. Daemon does want power, but he does love his brother.

“Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.” - Archmaester Gyldayn",0.0

"""House of the Dragon"" is inspired by George's book called ""Fire and Blood"" which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the Game of Thrones universe, the tragic fight was called  ""The Dance of Dragons"", and this event takes place 100 years before Daenerys.
The funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself, that's because ""The Dance of Dragons"" was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written, the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of Westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen.
And yes, it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished, so for the series we can expect less seasons than GOT, and a more complete story, different from the ending of got that was not written by George since the books still are not finished, but all the characters of ""House of the dragon"" were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes.

Hope i helpedxx",1.0
Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it. This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all.,0.0
"""Why is it always in breech"" Breech is 3-4%, and rises sharply with multiple births, like the queen has. It's not common, but it rises to between 1 in 20 to 1 in 10.",1.0
"My underestanding is that the wife wasn't going to survive either way. So it was a matter of ""letting the gods take them both"" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We've seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay's scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.

Also, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he'll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn't wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.

I'm really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven't seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei's chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys's racial ""change"" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some ""OMG WOKE"" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he's up there with Davos.

 Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.

And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I'm glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was ""There's never been a queen"" but one of the others was quick to chime in with ""Only out of precedent and tradition"". It's nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has ""hah, but she's a WOMAN!"" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.

Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don't like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.

Most of all, the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones.",0.0

This AveMaria composed by Igor Krutoy. Sang by Dimash. As you see this song is amazing 😊😍,2.0
"The composer of this is the piano player, Igor Krutoy. He came out of semi-retirement to work with Dimash. He has composed for people like Lara Fabian and Andrea Bocelli. 😄

Igor wrote a post about this song on his IG:

""One evening, about three months before the ""New Wave"", Dimash called me and asked if I could write ""Ave Maria "" for him, explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style... Coincidentally I had a free evening and I gladly sat down at the piano and, remembering the Italian formula of responsibility, worked with inspiration until I achieved the desired result. . . After taking a few days for the composition to ""rest"" in my ears, soul, and heart, I sent it to Dimash, who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear. And of course, the reception and applause given to Dimash by the audience at the ""New Wave"" show what a happiness it is to do what I love, to write for such a genius singer, to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand... Just a short essay on "" What is happiness?""""",2.0
"Me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y riéndose antes de que Dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido! Se quedaron mudos! Esta es la capacidad que tiene Dimash de cautivar al público, sin decir una sola palabra! Es maravilloso, esta es una composición de Igor Krutoy especialmente para Dimash, no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla, y vaya que lo logra! Gracias por su sincera admiración al magnifico Dimash! ❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽",2.0
"This vocalise of ""Ave Maria"" was composed by Igor Krutoy especially for Dimash.  It goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional song(s) is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power.  Nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as Dimash, the greatest vocalist I have ever heard in my 80+ years on this planet, and I've heard some really great singers along the way, and in every genre ever conceived.  What a blessing to experience this voice, this incomparable talent.  btw: Very nice reaction.",2.0

"Among the parts of the Indonesian anthem included by Novia Bachmid:
 1.  Lingsir wengi comes from the island of Java especially central Java.
 2.  Cik Cik Periuk comes from the Sambas, West Kalimantan.
 3.  Sinanggar Tulo came from Northern Sumatra.
 4.  Ayo Mama from the Maluku islands.
 5.  Anging Mammiri came from South Sulawesi.
 6.  Lalo Ngaro came from Sasak Lombok East.
 7.  Tanduk Majeng came from the Madura islands.
 8.  The last of our national anthem from Indonesia was the one of Mengheningkan Cipta, Shanna Shannon sang in white between the flames.
The one moment of silence Shannon has sung in memory of all the services our former heroes have fallen before us. The song we used to sing any at the time of the red and white flag ceremony. The song creeps us out every time we listen to it.

The bird that flies over that hill is also the symbol of our country, Indonesia. It's Garuda bird.
The eagle's state symbol also has a particular meaning:
 1.  The Garuda has our country's symbol, Indonesia.
 2.  The Garuda's hoof clings to a single Bhinneka Tunggal Ika when it comes from the book of Sotasoma by the Tantular Emphatti that has different meanings but one is also (tribe, religion, culture, and language).
 3.  The golden yellow represents majesty, constantly charging high in the dignity of a people of great and lofty character.
 4.  The number of feathers on the right and left wing is 17, which means the 17th day our country has been free from Dutch and Japanese rule for 350 years.
 5.  Tail feathers of 8 have the sense of August when we celebrate independence day.
 6.  Below the chain of shields connecting with the tail is the number 19 feather and the hair on the neck 45 (showing the figure of 1945, in which our country of Indonesia was free from the Dutch and Japanese rule in 1945).

The instrument is called Sasando and the hat is called Ti'i Langga. Both are Rote Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur. 

Alffy Rev says that the production of a video clip of the Wonderland Indonesia 2 times will take about 8 months, and early in the song, there are Kecak dancers involved with up to 300.

"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app",0.0

Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ✌️✍️",1.0

"It is true that we didn't hear Daemon said ""The Heir For A Day"" and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways. We are only told via Otto's report, and we know they despised each other. The labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way. Just like the title ""The Queen Who Never Was"" could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen. Maybe Daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew. One thing is for sure though, i think his love for his brother is genuine, however rogue his ways are. He knows his brother is weak and he sees Otto Hightower for what he is, he really wanted to protect his brother from crows that's waiting for a feast. He's definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting.",1.0
"19:32 ,that's what you got from Daemons smile? how are everyone giving daemon ""villain"" tag so quickly.  It feels like I saw some other episode and many other people saw another. It felt more like ""my brother knows me, he's right, these other idiots know nothing"" smile.
Daemon is Vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra & at the funeral.",0.0
I actually loved Daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would I do that about not making him his hand.Daemons immediate answer was cause I’m your brother!!It didn’t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn’t choose him and he’s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it’s a fact!,2.0

NB:like this comment  if you think so too . Cause i have a gut feeling by the end of this season or maybe next people will understand him (Eren yager effect)",1.0
"After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth, I didn't have very high hopes for this. Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons, maybe not quite there yet, but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it.

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.

Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne. In the end I think it will be between those two and Viserys will be long gone from the picture.",0.0
"They referenced the White Walker prophecy at the end. When the King was talking to his daughter. Seems it’s a warning passed from king to king. Little did they know it took 172 years to come to pass. And the King even says, A Targaryen has to be on the throne to win that Cold War!
Yes, it’s rumored the throne rejects those who aren’t worthy by cutting them!
This whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the Targaryen’s become the died off long lost house we see in Season 1 of GoT. When Daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed. 
So we’re gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from 10 dragons on total around in this series, to Dragons no longer even exist! In GoT and are old rumors. 
Each Targaryen pairs with a dragon, either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative. There are young and old dragons, dragon eggs, trainers and keepers! So cool",1.0
"Pretty sure that daemon didn't actually say the ""heir for a day"", even in the books it's implied that Otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers, and daemon just didn't want to say anything at that moment. He is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure",0.0

I don't support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but I can't just blind eye on things that Lakshya said just because I'm his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up, bulling, were some how true . Lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in YouTube because it's an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on Insta I guess Insta is not a public platform anymore and it's strike one thing that  lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content",1.0

"The best part about the teaser is that both Hrithik and Saif look drastically different from R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. And very honestly, Hrithik's Vedha is looking slightly more menacing than Vijay's.

"I love the original Tamil movie. The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor. The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique. The climax fight- Vedha has a 'come what may'/ unhinged/ chaotic attitude- and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight .. it was absolutely fresh to look at... Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik. I really don't want to compare VJS and Hrithik. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the remake. But the teaser does look promising. I love Hrithik's attempt at being the unhinged 'Vedha'. Except for the accent, as you rightly pointed out, the teaser does look promising. Even though the bgm is very good, I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head! I do miss it... I really really really hope and pray this movie does well...",2.0
"There's this eccentricity in Hrithik's eyes that tells me he'll do full justice to this role. He has his own unique style, and won't be just mimicking Vijay Sethupathy. I have faith in this movie because of the makers, really looking forward to it. People just have to approach it with an open mind, rather than being so negative even before the release.",2.0
"The only thing that's exciting me in this film is Hrithik's portrayal of a gray shaded character. Hrithik Roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles, it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform.",2.0
"That Sam CS BGM towards the end gave me massive goosebumps!!!
Vishal-Shekar and Sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack!!!!!!",2.0
The only thing that matters is box office. Hrithik's Agneepath was a box office hit and his Vijay is totally different from Amitabh's Vijay. If he can succeed in making a new Vijay then I don't know why people are saying can't match Vijay Sethupati. All that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if it's actually great.,1.0
"Initially      When I heard that Hrithik Roshan is playing role of Veda ,I doubted if he could fit into that role which Vijay Sethu Pathi immortalized that Character.After watching the Teaser I am surprised and excited to see Veda in this remake version.. Congratulations to both Heroes Hrithik Roshan and ofcourse  Vikram role is tailor made for Saif ali Khan .",2.0
"Fully agree with you regarding that scene where Vedha (Hrithik) is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets! People have the habit of complaining ... and most of the people who are complaining, they have not even watched the Original VV. And yes, Hrithik did not copy Amitabh, and similarly here, he did not copy the Great VS!",0.0
"In orginal movie and trailer specifically, both Vikram and Vedha were projected to be equals. Given equal screen time, dialogues and actions. But here I believe Hrithik is being pushed more than Saif and that's what bugs me..",0.0
"I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good",2.0
I like how they made Hrithik a bit devilish instead of Vedha being the calm guy like in the original. I feel like VJS's Vedha is how Mohanlal would've played Vedha and Hrithik's version is how Mammootty would've played the role.,1.0

finally!!!

"Jungkook and Jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances, they are both the ones I noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out, and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering. 

Jungkook has gotten injured multiple times, he's almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted MULTIPLE times or came close to it....

I of course worry about all the members but I always worry the most for Jimin & JK because we KNOW how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes :(",0.0
"Guys..I'll ask again. But may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed. I'd really like to see you to react to them as they are IMPORTANT parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history, shows how their emotions developed and changed over time, and give further context to a specific era /episode of the rise of bangtan. I hope you don't just brush them aside as it's really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like. Not sure why that changed but I hope you'll quickly return to them before it gets too far off. It's a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well. Because it gives you a mental break and as I said, really just gives you more and more context and content. As the series goes on they'll be more and more important to the series too. Whether that's answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldn't be further explored in the episode itself. You've already missed so much content. At the very least it's be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when it's importance hasn't diminished but increased every episode..",2.0
"Becoming ARMY truly is a life-changing experience, and one that anyone who hasn't done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand. I would have never thought that at the age of 54 I would become such a huge fan and supporter of the ""boyband"" my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point. 2 years later, almost to the day, and I look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me. Because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves, they have zero understanding and they all think I'm crazy, I think. All I can think is how sad it is that they won't give them a chance and experience the same thing I have. I like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is BTS. You guys are that kind of reactor and it's wonderful to see.",2.0

I really like to watch you react to Rise of Bangtan, but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on. Your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series? It’s fair id you don’t. This is just so weird, sorry",0.0

There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. 
""Oh! You're awake!"" The boy cries. ""So they are!"" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you...",2.0

Now here I am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee, fast internet, and my own custom PC. It took a lot to get here and I still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future. But for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years, just know that if I could make it, than so can you. I hope you will get to experience the same bliss I have at the moment. As we often forget to enjoy just today, when we keep thinking about the tomorrows

Checklist: 

• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧

• Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋

• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone🎧

• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕

• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨

•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

Water: did you know you can only survive a couple days with out it? Also it can help you concentrate
Lofi music: why not? It helps!!

Snacks- I find it hard to study on an empty stomach.
Breaks: Breaks are very important if you want to stay concentrated, and if you stretch out your back, you may be lucky and get a few good back cracks!
sleep: Sleep well at night!!!
Comfy space: Make your study space as comfy as possible! (just not to much so you will fall asleep!!)
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE (Unless all you are doing is work/studying and lofi girl music)
Also open up a window, its great for fresh air!!
And lastly your study stuff!!
Now go and study and stop looking at comments!!

 It's only the beginning. 
You have to get up
. Despite the numerous times you've been slammed into the ground you have to dust yourself off and ask ""is that all you got?"" Because you're strong. 
Know it. Own it. 
Trust me, I know. 
And if you have to go down, go down fighting with everything you've got. Never stop fighting. 
Please.
 I'm sure someday we will meet and show our battle scars and talk about how we made it. 
Sleep easy tonight.
 You need to rest.

You are not being measured by how tall you can stand, but by how many times you can get up before you give up. Run until your legs give out, swim until you drown, climb until you fall, life is short. Endure the agony that comes because it can't last. Why not see just how far you can go? I believe in you. Im running too. Im climbing too. Im swimming until I can't anymore. I refuse to drown.

reminder: if you are someone like me; someone who is kind of a perfectionist, or if u think ur life isn't ""good enough"" or ""messy""
here's some motivation: life is supposed to be messy, that's what makes life, 'life'. ""the way I see it if you want to see the rainbow you've got to put up with the rain"" -unknown. life is basically an adventure, there and ups and downs and smooth roads. won't it be boring if your life went EXACTLY the way you wanted it? the hard times are an experience, and the present time is a moment to appreciate.
so let's appreciate this beautiful life together, whatever you are going through, you will get through it. The rainbow will be across your head at the right time

"Me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Bebé soy

Entonces, ¿qué intentas hacerme?
Es como si no pudiéramos parar, somos enemigos
Pero nos llevamos bien cuando estoy dentro de ti
Eres como una droga que me esta matando
Te corté por completo
Pero me pongo tan alto cuando estoy dentro de ti

Sí, puedes empezar de nuevo, puedes correr libre
Puedes encontrar otros peces en el mar.
Puedes fingir que está destinado a ser
Pero no puedes alejarte de mi

Todavía puedo oírte hacer ese sonido
Tirándome rodando por el suelo
Puedes fingir que fui yo pero no

Bebé, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Bebé soy

Entonces si corro no es suficiente
Sigues en mi cabeza
Siempre atascado
Para que puedas hacer lo que quieras hacer
Amo tus mentiras, me las comeré
Pero no niegues al animal
Que cobra vida cuando estoy dentro de ti

Sí, puedes empezar de nuevo, puedes correr libre
Puedes encontrar otros peces en el mar.
Puedes fingir que está destinado a ser
Pero no puedes alejarte de mi

Todavía puedo oírte hacer ese sonido
Tirándome rodando por el suelo
Puedes fingir que fui yo pero no

Bebé, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Bebé soy

No digas mentiras, no puedes negar
La bestia dentro, si, si, si
No chica, no mientas, no puedes negar
La bestia dentro, si, si, si
Woah woah woah
Como animales

Bebé, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals

"It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo. As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water. We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water. Needless to say, we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother. We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight. Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day. That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals I've ever seen!",2.0

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just
A cannibal
And I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide

I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight

Here we go again [3x]

I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

"In the animal kingdom, the ability to hide, disguise yourself, blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter. In the African savannah, Zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into. In the Madagascan jungles, Chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb. In the warm tropics, Mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey. 

The Octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability. Polar Bears and the Arctic Fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra. Penguins play, unseen by predators, in Antarctica and the Snow Leopard rules the mountains of Southeast Asia. 

Animal Armory takes a closer look at these fantastical superpowers and the animals that wield them.

"There is a big mistake in this. The dazzle camouflage doesn't work to hide the zebra in the grass, it's designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target.

The same thing was used against submarines.",0.0

"I love that as  part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos. It is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that it's focused a lot on american context. :D Which is true, because from this video it looks like USA has one of the best educational systems, which is deffinetly not true. Here in the Czech Republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774. Also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools (public or private). Of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than USA, but I don't think you have the best one. But it's just my opinion, so please don't come at me... :D",2.0
"A more cynical perspective on why public (state-funded) education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient. They needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines. If the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state, then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use.

Worryingly, the same is happening nowadays. Many companies complain that people leave college/university and are ""not prepared to enter the workforce"". They want someone else to teach people to be good, efficient workers, so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day 1.",1.0
"Educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job. Though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition (neighborhood, preconceptions of people, and income) which affects HOW much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil (student). It’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in. Loved the references you used as well!

"We are teaching our children the wrong things in school. We are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections. This means when one section fails then the rest also fail. 

We need to teach our children to be independent.  Instead, we teach children how to be obedient workers.

To give meaning to someone's life teach them how to grow their own food, build their own house, repair their own car, cook their own meals, eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray. This gives life meaning.",0.0
Interesting. My learning style is: slow.,2.0
"My grade 8 science project, back in the late 80's, was on learning styles. My teacher was shocked and surprised when I submitted my project idea. All my subjects were my classmates. Over a span of a couple weeks I tested their comprehension of certain short stories, pictures, and videos; through visual, audio, and reading. When the science fair day came, my booth wasn't the most popular with any of the other kids, but with all the school teachers and parents... they loved it. I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning. No one method of learning is better than another, but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen. But I ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due.",2.0
"I worked as a high school teacher for thirty years. Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV. And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one. God forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience, education and intelligence.",0.0
"I had an excellent, and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style *WAS* his teaching style. I recall, one day for an hour long lecture, he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs, and he never said a single word. In another day, he switched his handwriting to beautiful, perfect cursive. He was a bizarre teacher, but pushed me to the absolute limit. Great prof!",2.0
"I’ve been self-studying A-Level Maths for the last two years and I think the real method to learning in my own experience is ‘repetition’. Similar to how you would work out in a gym, the more you do it the better you become at it.

I think I’ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school.",2.0
"i'm a pressure learner, i only learn school material when there's severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me",0.0
"People learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic. Also, if you understand schooling, as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades, and education, as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest, it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know, but also, that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually, making people dumber.",0.0
"I'm a teacher in New Zealand and VARK was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago. We did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences, but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching, ie try and give the children a verbal aspect, and an auditory aspect, and a reading aspect, and a kinaesthetic aspect. That sounds more like the multi-modal approach you described. I remember I came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well. She looked at it and said ""I don't want to read all that, can't you read it to me?""",2.0
"I feel like the ""learning styles"" myth has ultimately HELPED teaching, though.  It's encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their TEACHING style in order to (in their minds) reach a wider variety of learners.

"Twenty years ago I gave a small talk about VARK to my fellow educators. The key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate, but complement each other in a holistic manner.

"As someone who grew up doing Common Core—

It just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class, it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it, and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other Common Core materials for essentially no benefit to the students.

"Apologies for not watching the whole video.  As a former student and a parent of students, I know the system was broken long before common core.  I remember in college, my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide, because I was so deficient on the basics--though I did well in English all through school.  I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn't prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  

Things have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of ""No Child Left Behind"" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn't graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  

Too much government involvement means teachers aren't allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren't just expected to educate students.  Now, they've got to feed them, clothe them, teach them manners and how to get along, look out for abuse, deal with all their special needs, (and accompanying IEPs,) head off bullying, deal with allergies and medical conditions, worry about gender identity and sexuality, discipline fairly, deal with ""helicopter parents,"" check the boxes for college prep, and deal with the ever-present worry over school shootings.  

With all we're expecting from schools and teachers, it's a wonder anyone goes into this profession, or stays once they see the outlook.  

Common core, like No Child Left Behind, is a great idea on paper, that fails in implementation.  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were well-educated.  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses, and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students.  It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom.  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs.  They increased class sizes.  And they started charter schools--which were experimental programs.  

Imagine if all those billions spent on common core, were used to pay teachers more--and get out of their way.",0.0

A good grade in citizenship meant you didn't give the teachers any trouble: you had learned to go along to get along.

"Thanks, well done Sprouts and the visuals are just amazing. Dewey's theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for Education.

For the discussions it is important that some teacher  instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussion/debate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas.

"This thing is also evident in India. Students preparing for NEET/JEE (and for many other competitive exams) who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who can't afford to go to these coachings. Most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are IITians, doctors, etc. These coachings provide great facilities to their students, so the results are obvious. There are very few government colleges (of class 11 and 12) in India who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams.

"I'm from India and here, students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam. Due to covid the exams were postponed in April (which is the usual time they happen). Now when the country has hit peak infection the Central Government has decided to hold all the exams. At least 30 million students attempt these exams each year. Despite the clamour from the students and Opposition, the Government is proceeding with it. Students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside.

1. Due to the rains, many regions are flooded, families displaced and property destroyed.

2. Transportation is nearly impossible. Some States have still not lifted the lockdown, so trains, buses and taxis are either unavailable, or charge exorbitant rates.

3. The Exam Centres are few and far between, particularly in the rural areas. Without means of transportation, students are unable to reach the exam centres. Even if they do manage to arrange for transport, as hotels and restaurants are closed, or open only for takeout, they cannot find safe accomodation

4. Many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs. They all have entrance exams in September. If a student tests positive due to any of these exams, either he cannot take the exam, or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness. 

And like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation.

The government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety This is a no win situation for both students and their families.  The government has no solution that affects millions of students' education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam.

I came from a state owned school and finished my high school examination with A grade. Then, I enrolled in a state owned university and completed my bachelor degree last month. Recently, I joined a Management Trainee Program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top 5 spots to be qualified. One of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries (she spent 3 years in Singapore and one year in Australia) and I can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages, skills, and knowledge. It’s hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries don’t even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young. To my knowledge, one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the English language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language, namely “Khmer”. Ideally, I hope those students will obtain the proficiency in English language, then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now.",1.0

"I've been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years. I've also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.

The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there's no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. 

The second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn't be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that's their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.

The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population's education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you've been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).

The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It's up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the ""decision makers"" (sales people) set for the parents.

The final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what ""national curriculum"" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the ""national curriculum"". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I've been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they're sales people at best.
I should also mention that many parents have no clue about education, yet influence the schools with their misconceptions...but this is not the parents' fault. Rather, it's the school's fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program.

As for price... it's simply about demand vs supply.  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before, combined with a desperate middle class (and higher) trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost. They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler.

Unfortunately I exited the market, partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problems...mostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum.",0.0
"My sons were in Chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively.  I am French and their mom and Chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system.  Until the 6th grade, the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work.  now, as bi-cultural kids, they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son.  From 6th grade onwards, the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results.  the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave.  Bullying by teachers can also occur.  my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school.  he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates.

This 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden.  what it didn't do is address some fundamental issues with the system:

- Teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students - instead they push them out
- Everything is based on 2 tests:  one in grade 9 and one in grade 12.  These tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills (even if that has improved a bit) - system should be reformed to take equivalent of GPA into account.  this would ease a lot of the pressure
- The last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow

There is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education.  Yes most of them will have strong language and math skills.  But a lot of it is mechanical.

"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.
I would also point out that every doctor in the world (with common sense) would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue.
It's funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stress-free education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months.

"I found this very interesting, and as someone with ADHD-I, I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it.

It brought up so many points of interest. With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution, ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time, and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking. From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses. As time went on this idea continued but in a different way. By the 1920's there was a drive towards raising the standards of living. People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked, and live in the suburbs in a house, get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style.

But like he said in the talk, this type of trend doesn't work anymore. Styles of life are so divergent and it's obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women aren't going to be stay at home mom's and many can't. Actually during the 60's many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life. And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living.

As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child. I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior, but not always both. Take your eyes for example. You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly, so you get prescription lenses. You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription. And no one asks why.

No one asks why are you like this, how did it happen. Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it. Yes and no. You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions, but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met. Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors. Your nutrition, your genetics and your life style. Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight, by changing their diet and their habits. For instance a child who stays inside all day, watching TV and playing videogames for hours, refuses to eat his vegetables and who's parents or relatives have had glasses, may develope near sightedness.

So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day, not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity, exploring their real world, developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating, interacting socially with others around them, making constant decisions, based on logic, real feelings, and experiences, and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills, in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner. And it doesn't just go for ADHD. This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty. In varying degrees of course. But it is believed that behavior (in any form) is partially learned and partially developed. And by developed I mean the way your brain developed. How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works.

Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set can't work for everyone. As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts, you find contradiction. Most people don't understand the arts. Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesn't make sense anymore. Truth is that area of education evolved, but only by those who pursue it, would understand. A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world. The A grade is the pinacle of that idea.  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A. 

Well this doesn't really work in the art world. You still get graded when you do your work and do it well, but school is for practicing the academics. In art you study academics as well, like art history, art Theory, and your use of a medium like drawing or painting. What you don't get graded on is on the things that can't be measured, like your idea, your creativity, and the value of your work. Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill. But when it comes right down to it, art isn't about any of this or it can be about all of it. It can be about how others value your work, it can be about how divergent your work seems to be, it can be about how well your work matches a subject, it can be about how well you use methods of design, it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people, and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic (AKA art competition or auction). So in a way it is chaotic to the point people can't make sense of it any more, but it is not inherently measurable and perfected.

It is the product of ideas. And ideas are valued above all else. And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms, and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty.",2.0

"I've been listening to this guy's speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything I have seen in a long time. I was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school (this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so I know). So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this. I wouldn't have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience, which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity.

"I certainly remember being much better at being creative when I was younger, but now that I'm a freshman in High School, I've noticed that I'm much worse at the whole creativity thing. Now, the problem is, I'm being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It's one of the closest classes to an actual job that's available at my school. And I'm not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard. I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It's telling me that there's one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.",0.0

While the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school, associates, undergraduate, and graduate diplomas, quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race.

"It seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to Society, and do good things. And the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the World.

"Great discussion! Thank you. Yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future. I would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future 'useless people'. My government (in Africa) has done nothing to help the people. All it has done is line the pockets of the politicians. Education is already being re-engineered today by the private sector - Udacity, Coursera come to mind. There are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world. So the future of the youth of today depends on THEM. Thomas Friedman in his book 'Thank You for Being Late' suggests that the previous 'digital divide' between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the Motivational Divide. The youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated (and overcome the natural laziness that Yuval tells us about) and learn, and keep learning. What they need to know is WHAT to learn, then learn it with the help of the Internet, organisations like Udacity, Khan Academy, Coursera and coaches and mentors (teachers in the world of yesterday). Schools also need to embrace these changes.",1.0

"Masters Union cannot replace institutions like IIM or IIT because of the sheer fact that MU does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university. Indian colleges or Universities don't have any place in the top institutes of the world (and rightly so) but something that an IIT or IIM has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy.
Because of the implementation of reservation, there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects (Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy. I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation) and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but, the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who haven't had access to great education in their schools/colleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education. But in an institution like Masters Union (going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship) the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds, who have had access to great education since kindergarten. While Masters union assures great education, institutions like IITs and IIMs, ensure social equity and great education

"I D E A for new civilization experiment:
Nations are split on the big continent and a small lake isle in the center of continent
The nations are: Plains: boost to farming and gathering resources (get more of them) + they have additional heart in ther region, but they have -1 heart in other regions (so making a nation to defend, rather then attack) Structures: Castle and village next to it
Jungle: Jump higher and get much lower fall damage (can build special sorts of bases, I guess), but -1 heart overall. Structures: Aztec Temple and village on trees
Desert: Loses less hunger bars over time
+ other nations in their region lose 1 heart, but the desert people lose 1 heart in other regions, like the Plains. Structures: A pyramid and a trading post
Swamp: Their potions are more effective and lasting + they don't need to kill blazes to make potions, but they have -1 heart in THEIR region. Structures: Giant witch hut
Islanders (live on their own island) : Faster swimming on boats and themselves, better fishing efficiency, but the isle is little and not much land is fertile (that makes them invade others) Structures: Seaport / Dock and Coastal village. 
Snow: It is very cold there and people are brutal. They are -2 heart s in the beginning, but for every kill they get +1 heart (that makes them an aggressive, unstable society), but they can eat only meat (because they probably have never seen vegetables) Structures: igloo village plus Viking fort
Mountains: Quick diggers (1,5x speed)
Structures: Forgotten mine + dvarvish fortress
The situation of the regions: 
               Snow                  Mountains


Plains                  Islanders              Swamp

Thanks for sharing! The “study like it’s your last test” even though you’re taking it twice is an interesting approach. I get the value in it but I actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out. I tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again!

"Notes:
-All the information you’ll need will be on the test, whether it’s in the passage or the little introduction brief
-Before reading the passage, skim the questions to see if there’re any summary/theme questions, and take note of the vocab words
-Remember to read the title/little introduction
-For vocab questions, read the whole sentence, plus maybe the sentences before and after for context. Then substitute in each answer
-Know what certain terms are (7:04)

For two-part questions:
-Look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage
-Then read the first question (only the question) and try to see which quote answers every part of the question
-Compare the quote to the first question’s answers

For the literature passage:
-Try to be engaged/to have fun
-Read challenging books beforehand

For the debate passages:
-Read the first passage and answer all the passage-1-specific questions while it’s still fresh in your mind
-Repeat for passage 2

-Especially for the Science-based passages, don’t infer anything. Use the passage/graphs to back up each answer",1.0

The first time I took it I barely understood a lot of the math on it because I wasn't even completely through Algebra 2.

Since I score a 1500+, it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99%. I think the part about scores being inflated because schools don't have to report bad test scores since students aren't submitting bad tests scores makes sense. However, I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the U.S. World News Report requires a school to report at least 50% of its students' scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings.

I like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education. In highscool I was a 2.0 gpa student. Barely putting the effort to muster a C.

Had no friends no job and overall I was in a bad state in hs. I just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer. But yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished I could go back and change that so I wouldn’t have made it harder on myself. I didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life. Starting to change now How I am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier.

"First of all, let me clear up the misunderstanding about why Asians do well in life: we do not always send kids off to academic supplements, SAT study classes, etc... Obviously, there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go, but there are a plethora that do just as well, if not better on these types of activities (SAT, ACT, GPA, school, etc...) without any additional help, aside from a practise test book from the local library. That is me, and I can affirm that for many Asian kids, we have an inherent need to do good, make our parents proud (no matter how much pressure we have), and have a high-level job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us. We push for the best because of our work ethic, not because all Asians have ""oh so much money"". For the majority of our parents, as immigrants, it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour, the hard work, the exhaustion, and the prejudice they have faced in the past, all to provide their children with more opportunities. It is not that Asians are inherently smarter, or richer, or more privileged in any ways (although there are those select few), but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today. Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin, to say: Mexicans, African-Americans, Indians, and other ""dis-privileged minorities"" in the States. The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties. Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end? I am not trying to start up any racial slurs, cursing, or insultations of any kind, just putting out a thought and consideration for you all. Obviously, there are many successful, talented, and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones, but I am just making a point here: Why would the high-level universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of ""racial preference"" or ""racial advantage""? Note I put that in quotations, meaning I myself do not think that is a fact. There are hard-working and lazy people, smart and ignorant, good and bad in any race, it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public. So tell me, why should one race get more ""sympathy"" or ""preference"" over another? Can we not just all be equal human beings? It is like saying ""red is better than pink!"" Why? ""Oh, because it is true!"" without an explanation. So, what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me, due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl, and I wanted to share the truth to everyone. Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully, we can all start changing society little by little, with messages like this! No enmities I hope! :)",2.0

"My predictions (will edit after I get results):

Reading/writing: 710-740
Math: 790-800
Overall: 1500-1540

Edit 1 (a few hours after taking the test): Feel really confident about the math section, reading was way easier than usual, and writing had a bunch of easy questions but had a few that I couldn't figure out the differences (parts of sentence replacement, not grammar)

Edit 2 (1-2 months after taking the test): yea... I forgot about where I left this comment. Anyways I took two SATs, march 2nd school day and march 12th.

2nd: r/w 750, math 790, overall 1540
12th: r/w 760, math 800, overall 1560
superscore the same as 12th

honestly surprised with reading/writing, especially the reading section. I missed 1 reading on the 2nd (but that was 40 subsection so didn't matter) and 4 on the 12th. 5 writing on 2nd and 1 on writing.

Math I missed 1 question due to not reading carefully and 1 because I didn't know how to do it on the 2nd, but perfect score on the 12th.

if I got the reading section of the 2nd and the writing section of the 12th on the same day, I could have a score of 1590.

definitely not taking the SAT again",2.0

"So I took the SAT practice test 10 right... I usually score 1360-1400 on a practice test. I make a total of 5 mistakes on the math section on a bad day, which is what happend.

40/44 in writing is translated to 330 (70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers).
33/52 is translated to 280 (Fine).
53/58 is translated to 710 (90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers). 
A total of 1320. Even though I did exteramly good in the writing section, just above averge in reading (which is a totally flawed section but that's another topic), and amazing in the math section I got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school.

Can you please do a video on how the math section on the SAT is scored,1.0
The fact that they don’t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video. What do u call saying that one test is harder than another  so they can get more wrong. Even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating. This is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar. And even though this may be harder for the English section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a CURVE because there is no other word for what ur doing.,0.0

Im a Brazilian student struggling if it's worth applying to the US. 
I did a in-depth research, some “mock” sat’s at home, and have a strong sympathy for certain American colleges' education structure as compared to Brazilian or European universities, which I'm fortunate to have the citizenship in both places. Nevertheless, if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years, I’d have to eliminate one of my options, whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both. 
While balancing my studies for the local admissions test(Fuvest-USP), the EPFL’s entrance exams in French, and a few EC’s, I obtained a couple of 1550+ scores at home following all the procedures as time-monitored tests. I judge my English as near-fluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9. Above all, I have a strong passion for physics, mathematics, and technologies(mainly AI related to physics research).
I also would be prone to take SAT II, and possibly AP exams, as well as the TOEFL to sum up with my 9.6 out of 10 GPA.
My main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest - math or physics with computer science.
I have participated weekly in two educational NFOs since I was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work, some calls, and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher, which I loved; I had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until I started piano lessons one year ago; I have been taking English and French private lessons for 4 years; and played varsity state-level soccer, being the captain until the pandemic started. I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I won't regret, however, I awfully believe that my extracurriculars aren't good enough for top 20 schools and I'm inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education, but entirely different from what I've expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art. 
Back to my financial means, I'm entirely grateful for the opportunities that I already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of $25,000 per year from my parents. By converting my mother’s income to USD(~$35,000) we would qualify for 100% financial support from need-based universities, and those would be my goals.
My question is, am I a strong applicant for America’s A-1 universities undergrad or have I lost my chance by not investing in a passion project?",2.0

However, I know I am not the only one who is frustrated with getting 'easy' problems incorrect on the SAT.

"Truly inspiring video. The presentation is truly flawless, and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game. I love how you used pocket edition, because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game, and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out. Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles. I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base, as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them. Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding. If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay, we can find that the player is holding a torch, just like the many around his shelter. This means the torches around the base has just been placed, and shows how you can move forward in life, no matter how dire the situation may seem. In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area, and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what. Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning, showing how even if someone is in their home, they are never safe of the dangers outside, and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety. I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape, which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls. Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit, as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them, thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there, and how even though you may be small compared to the universe, the impact you make can change the world. Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending, where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the player's dedication. It also is in a slightly smaller frame, and black bars replace the outer edges, which show that even though you try your best, there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey, and how much different it could have been if you have done something different, which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible, without itching ones testicles. The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt ""blue"" or sad about ending, but still proud of what they accomplished, and is hopeful for what is to come.

A really poetic performance, really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls. I can't wait to see more work from you.

"Personally, I think education (or, specifically, a lack thereof) is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this -- because ignorance breeds fear and distrust, especially in things that are new or foreign.

When I was in elementary school, back in the 70's, I was reading my way through my school's sci-fi section. It was just a few shelves, but it had almost all the classics... Asimov, Bova, Bradbury, Campbell, Clarke, Doc Smith, Heinlein -- and then I got to Verne. I'd just finished up 30,000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book.

Being a good student, I reported it to the Librarian... but instead of focusing on the missing page, she was outraged that I was reading this particular book. It was ""above my level"" she said, and ""too difficult"" for me. This was a hundred-year-old story at this point, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a difficult one to follow -- the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays! But she still took the book away... and over the next few weeks, that sci-fi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there.

A short time later, I overheard her talking to another teacher about, of all things, a ""shooting star"" -- a meteor that many had seen a night or two before. The Librarian was mocking the teacher because ""a shooting star is impossible -- the Heavens are permanent! The stars don't move!"" As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor, it seemed to both terrify and outrage her. And the longer that conversation went on the more even I (maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time?) realized -- the sci-fi books she had removed weren't above MY level, they were above HER level. She had no understanding of science, and all these sci-fi stories about starships, robots, and alien worlds were things that she just didn't understand... and because of that, they scared her, so she locked them away.

"Having done a lot of diving - I can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter. Some (mostly the younger ones) are ... So curious. At first it's like ""WOW! U THREAT?!"" once it establishes that you are not, it's like ""Eeer ... What are you then? I've never seen one of you around before."" and there begins the act of mutual curiosity :3. You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it'll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to ""why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special"". They really hold a very special place in my heart, it's not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding :)",2.0
"I worked with a marine biologist studying cephalopods. He had one big tank for octopuses and one for crabs, their favorite food. One morning he came in and found that one of his octopuses had pushed the lid open on his tank, crossed the floor and climbed into the crab tank. Soon it became a common occurrence. He decided to give the octopus a mild shock when he found it in the crab tank to deter it. Within days he came in and found the octopus had still gone to the crab tank, eaten it's fill, but then climbed back to its own tank to avoid the shock.
They are amazing animals.",1.0
"My favorite creature ever.  I was on a crab ship in Russia.  I was the green horn so I had to empty out the pots.  I was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden (it was lighting in a cup) so I could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals.  One day there was an octopus in a crab pot.  I tossed it a live well. Came back once everyone was off the deck.  Was gonna take it to the chef. it softly wrapped itself around my arm and I felt like I could see the fear in its eyes.  I couldn't do it.  I took it over to the side of the ship, held it over.  It looked down, looked back at me, let go of my arm, and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water.  AMAZING CREATURES!",2.0
"I think cephalopod intelligence is “hard wired”. An octopus has a very short lifespan, as little as 18 months, and has to learn everything from the moment it hatches completely on its own.

Its mother died before it emerged from the egg, so it is born an orphan. This has huge implications, because despite being intelligent it has no “mentor” to learn from.

It’s also a mollusk, so in a way it’s a slug with awesome superpowers.

They’re fascinating animals.",1.0
"I can genuinely say I have never been more astounded by another being on this planet.  The evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world.

"One of the most amazing species of Octopus is the Mimic Octopus, it not only uses it's shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators (when being chased by a damselfish it'll make itself look like a banded sea snake, which is a damsel fish predator) but also to hunt (imitating a crab to draw in another crab). The list of animals it's been observed to imitate is quite long (Jelly Fish, Lionfish, Sea Snakes, Zebra Sole, Flatfish, Giant Crab, Sea Horses ect) it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we don't know about (the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals).",2.0

"I am very thankful for this presentation, I was afraid I was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology. Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move, in a since, chemically. That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change. We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells. Great  discussion.",2.0

I once was kayaking with my father in Florida when I took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore.

"Coming back on that lecture, you're an absolute gem Robert Sapolsky. I've discovered this video a year ago, searched my way through the infite possibilities of life, finally started my bachelor in psychology, and I head on becoming a researcher in evolutionary psychology or something like that if things go well and if I still like it. Hopefully I see you some day at Stanford University",2.0
This is an absolutely amazing lecture because he doesn't just dive into the subject. He outlines the way to approach it without thinking in boxes. Its a refresher for scientific and critical thinking abilities. Designed to help unravel a very complex and challenging subject. I think I'm going to be spending some quality hours here with the Dr. One of his lectures on KoKo the gorilla brought me to this playlist.,2.0
The fact that baby orcas have to learn their language shows how intelligent these beings are,2.0
the fact that whales/dolphins can legally just be kept at places like Seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video.,0.0
21:50 It's really fascinating to see the Orca's movements in front of the mirror. They move with this careful consideration and grace that you also see in species like the dolphin or gorilla. Or humans for that matters.,2.0
"When I was a kid, I was a given a plush orca that immediately became my best friend
It wasn't until years later that I found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans' food chain 
and honestly I just fell in love with them even more",2.0
One of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn’t mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca. But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt. They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they’re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets. Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,2.0
"The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe 'lhol mechen, which means 'our relatives who live under the sea' or 'the people under the waves.' Orcas live in tight-knit families. In most cases, both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives (this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents). Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social. Their limbic system (the part of the brain that processes emotion) is incredibly developed and complex. Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate. They're the only species, besides humans, pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals, that go through menopause.

Famous Southern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Lolita, Granny, Ocean Sun, Tahlequah (who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days), Moby Doll, Shamu, Luna (there's a documentary about Luna called The Whale)

Famous Northern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Namu, Corky, Tsitika, Eve, Sharky, Top Notch, Springer (the only orca to have been successfully re-integrated back into the wild)

Famous Transient orcas (mammal-eaters) : Lonesome George, Fatfin, Chainsaw, Esperanza, Sidney and her children, Raksha and her five daughters",2.0
I remember watching Black Fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of Orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it. Really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,0.0
"Orcas really are the humans of the sea. They're everywhere, eat anything, work in groups, have dialects, pass down skills over generations, and have great teamwork skills. If they were humans I would say they are in a sort of ""tribal stage."" It's only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another.",2.0
"I love that seafaring mammals evolved out of the ocean, were unimpressed with the land, and just went back.",2.0
What a dream it would be to be able to actually communicate to orcas at some point. Communicating with other intelligent species is so huge,2.0

Thank you for this lecture. I'm still amazed about origin of those tools.,2.0
"In my dissertation work, I used the non-fluorescent halves of different fluorescent proteins and engineered expression vectors for genes that encoded these appended to target proteins (wt and oncogenic mutant c-Fes kinases) such that the targets would be competent/functional with the attached FP halves, but then when they bind/dimerize/oligomerize to perform phosphorylation-dependent enzymatic activity, then the FP halves would bind as well to become a whole fluorescent protein tagging the target protein dimers! This approach allowed us to observe the action of our targets, localization, quantify dimerization (as a proxy for kinase function in this case as well), etc. Molecular biology is built upon so many tools/techniques that are in and of themselves amazing!",1.0

"Expand to see important notes for this video. 1) This video, as stated in the description, focuses on general functions of biomolecules. The biomolecules: carbs, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, can all can have important functions in the body.  *This is a video about the general function of biomolecules. For your dietary needs, consult with a dietitian or medical doctor.*  2) We mention the popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules. As we mention, these are basics. There can be more elements (such as sulfur for example in proteins), but we wanted to identify *common elements starting at the building block level.*  At the building block level, *some amino acids lack sulfur* for example. It's not just sulfur. For example, there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen. The popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level. 3) Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates, one character for lipids, and one character for proteins - unfortunately, when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type, it isn't designed to show a specific type. We received a great point in an email though that, since our little lipid character is a triglyceride, this can be confusing when naming lipid functions. For example, at 3:52 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane, it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there won't be any confusion as we do not want to imply that *specific* lipid type makes up the cell membrane. [Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well]. We plan to explore creating individual, detailed videos on lipids, carbs, and proteins where we can show different types.

• _They lack a stomach:_ Platypuses (platypodes and platypi are technically also correct, but much rarer in use) aren't the only animals to forgo an acid-producing part of the gut; spiny echidnas, and nearly a quarter of living fishes all have a gullet that connects directly to their intestines.

"There's a lot more unusual stuff ""under the hood"" of these guys (and their Echidna cousins). Their skeletons for example, have 'epipubic bones' aka ""pouch bones"" which are only found in Marsupials and Monotremes. But more unusual still, they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle, while ALL other mammals have only two. On a human for example, the pectoral girdle (aka, the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder) is made of two bones: the scapula (shoulder blade) and Clavicle (collar bone), with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum. It means that we, like 'all' mammals, can pivot our shoulders around, not just the arms within the socket. Compare this to birds/reptiles and older Tetrapod groups and you'll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle, with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum. This third bone is the 'Coracoid' bone, and mammals lost it a long time ago... except in Monotremes. On the plus though, like the rigid flight frame of a bird, it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why Platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim (or echidna to dig). Splayed legs, more ribs than other mammals, low body heat,  eggs, venom, etc. honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointy-nosed hedgehog.",1.0

Birds, being warm-blooded reptiles, show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles. Why wouldn't amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another?",1.0

"Has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus? I would very much like to see that! Since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons (e.g. throughout the animal, including each leg, which has the ability to feel, taste and smell) it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of ""brain."" They already have their own video channels such as 'Octolab' etc, but I remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees.

I'd dearly love to see these creatures advance thru the eons!",2.0
"An animal evolving a foam-like cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept, goddamn. Now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm. Over millions of years, the glands adapt. Eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin.

We now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles. This sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life",2.0
"I’m sorry. But I laughed every time you said “greater moist boy.” Every time. 
This was another great speculative world! And I liked that it was an alternate history of our own planet. The last few videos have taken us to some truly insane alien worlds, which I have LOVED, but it always feels nice to come back home and speculate about our own pale blue dot, and all the ways it could have turned out differently. I love your channel so much.",2.0
"There were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time.  They stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammer-fit it into each of the niches.  Amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned.    Amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of ""amphibian"".  Every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure.  Evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well.  Predator prey relationships drive evolution.  Fast running prey animals and predictors are an example.  Size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors.  Amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many don't have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs.  This limits size.  The larger the animal the more oxygen is needed.  That's why lungs evolved.  This would also change mouth and nose shape.",1.0

"One thing about the inhabitated lodge: given its a desert animal (I think) it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back. A protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment.
 And given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggs/tadpoles in Chambers of there belly, this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal.
In addition this could be a way to get ""mammalian"" or ""placentalian"" amphibians of sorts, if it would continue to evolve along this line",2.0
"I love these what if speculative documentaries! I love the ideas of what if some animals were the dominant species. Friggin love the Moist Bois and the Freeple.
My favorite idea is a cephalopod world. In the game Splatoon, the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold. It's kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation, science gone wrong, or the lack of mammalian predators. So I wonder what a squid or octo world would be like. Would both evolve simultaneously like the Inklings and Octolings did? Would civilization rise again? I dunno, I wonder what a realistic Splatoon world would be where sealife, specifically invertebrates, evolved.",2.0

Along with that here is what I quickly typed down as a sort of SUMMARY, feel free to fix:

 William Prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea. Also discovered food is divided into carbs, fats, and proteins

 Carbohydrates are the source of all energy 

 Carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides

 Glucose, a monosaccharide, number 1 sugar that comes from the sun

 Fructose, same chemical as glucose, but arranged differently, and is sweeter

 Disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together

 Sucrose, fructose and glucose connected, is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond

 Polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units

 Cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules

 Bread is made of starch and amylase

 Our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them

 We store our energy long term through fat aka lipids

 Lipids are non polar and can’t dissolve in water

 Fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids

 Saturated fats don’t have double bonds, while unsaturated fats do

 Trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body

 Omega 3 fats, unsaturated, are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them

 Phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in

 Phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar

 Steroids, a phospholipid made of 4 carbon rings, are used to make cholesterol

 Proteins of made of 20 amino acids which do everything for the body

 Nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food, via foods high in protein

 Polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids

 The 9 essential amino acids, which are bodies can’t make on their own, are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine",1.0

"Since the animations are kinda confusing the numbers up, I recapped the transformation here:

*Glycolysis*

Glucose + 2 ATP >> 2 Pyruvates + Energy.
This energy is used for making 4 ATP (net profit of 2 ATP) and 2 NADH from 2 ADP, 2 NAD+ and 2 hydrogen (probably H+).

*Fermentation*

Pyruvate >> Energy + Lactic Acid.

*Krebs Cycle*

2 Pyruvates + 2 O₂ >> 2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 CO₂ + Energy.
This energy is used to form 2 NADH from NAD+ and hydrogen.
2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 Oxaloacetic Acid >> 2 Citric Acid.
2 Citric Acid + 4 O₂ >> 2 Oxaloacetic Acid + Energy + 4 CO₂.
This energy is used to make 2 ATP, 6 NADH and 2 FADH₂.
So after the Krebs Cycle we now have 10 NADH, 2 FADH₂ and 4 ATP (or 6 if you count the ATP spent in Glycolysis).

*Electron Transport Chain*

10 NADH >> Energy + 10 NAD+ + 10 Hydrogen.
This energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria. They went back through the ATP synthase creating at most 3 ATP for each NADH, for a total of 30 ATP (at most).
2 FADH₂ >> Energy + 2 FAD+ + 4 Hydrogen.
This energy is also used to pump some protons. This creates, at most, 2 ATP each FADH₂, for a total of 4 ATP.

_Conclusion:_
_Total ATP created: 38 molecules, if the cell is very efficient._
_2 ATP is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most 40 ATP that went through the steps._
_10 NAD+ were used, and probably reused._
_2 FAD+ were used, and also probably reused._
_6 O₂ were used and they became 6 CO₂ in the Krebs Cycle._
_2 Oxaloacetic Acid were used and reused._

"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology. 

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us.",0.0

"Notes:


Animal cell

Eukaryotic cells, with membrane ,organelles and nucleus containing DNA that calls the shots 
Animal, plants, fungi and protist
Flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants, allowing the creation of cell, organs and tissue types

Cell is like a city:

On the surface:

Microtubials: made of long protein fibers: Cillia (tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up) and Flagella (whip-like tail like in sperms), Protozoans, move with Microtubials instead of muscle tissue
Membrane: Selective permeability: monitoring coming in and out like boarders

Inside:

Cytoplasm: water+nutrients
Cytoskeleton: scaffolding made of protein strands, Centrosomes: infrastructures
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): network of membranes like a highway system 

The smoother parts of ER are like factories: 
containing enzymes (proteins) producing lipids, 
detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water, 
storing ions like Sodium used for energy

The rougher parts of ER have Ribosomes attached to them:
Synthesis and packaging of proteins

Ribosomes: float freely, assemble amino acids into Polypeptides pushing the protein chain into ER where it's bitten off and sent to Golgi Aparatus

Golgi: made of membranous layers: the post office for packaging proteins, cutting them into hormones, combining them with Carbs to make molecules
Vessicles: the packages with Phospholipid walls

Lysosome: waste treatment and recycling, sacks containing enzymes breaking down cell waste into building material 

Mitochondria: the power plant where respiration takes place, fuels converted to Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which is the currency 
They were separate bacteria that animal cells absorbed and kept, and they still act as their own organisms with their own DNA, they exist in the egg and doesn't mix with sperms DNA during fertilization

Nucleus:

The leader
Contains DNA and has all the information and instructions

Has a double membrane
Nucleoplasm (is like Cytoplasm)

I had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas, or liquid, and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally, which is where my mom got the idea that Dragons would have a crop like chickens have, and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of Flint that would go into that crop. When the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gas/liquid came up, igniting and sending out flames.

"A summary!

Video Two: Water
 H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.
 All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds (between the positive and negative poles of different molecules)
 Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.
 Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).
 Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.
 Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).
 Capillary action is water defying gravity.
 Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity). 
 Hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.
 Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.
 Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily (when frozen).
 Water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat, thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets.",2.0

"There are also natural bonsai, they form in small pockets of soil on certain rock formations and are really rare.",1.0
"So, a bonsai could theoretically become a normal, huge tree when planted elsewhere. But the question is, is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger? Or is the tree happy when it’s small too? The obvious answer is no, the tree doesn’t care. Another answer would be “we have no way of knowing.” People like to assign emotions to things, but a lot of the time those emotions are just self-reflection. 

People assign the wrong emotions to animals too, even though we know animals can feel emotion, people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly. This happens all the time. 

So even when we find out trees can experience emotion (and some evidence already suggests this) we would probably still force our own perspective onto them, like we do now.

What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do, with the conditions they are given. Are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are? I don’t think trees know this concept. I think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants. In fact, people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it. The trees definitely don’t need it either.",0.0

They are repotted, pruned (the roots too), wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape. Of course, it isn't neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger, but as long as they are kept healthy I don't see a problem with it. I think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential, and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings.",1.0

Now my brain is a contradiction in terms, in that I’m Mathematically challenged (seriously algebra might as well be sandscript) but I understand calculus (I’ve never found anyone that explain this to me lol). So when Dr Tyson was explaining Quantum entanglement I got the concept but I needed more info (like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe). And I know I’m just some guy but after reading everything I could get my hands on (that wasn’t written for PHD candidates) it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars. My physics teacher in HS said that the only natural force that humans can’t manipulate is Gravity and we’d have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems. But (excuse my ignorance) if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit",1.0

At higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration (wave) function starts to reveal itself. What is missing in our science at the particle level is the inclusion of the interaction between the particle and the energy dissipated from the device used to observe it (equipment or human brain).",1.0

The hardest part of that first trick is wrestling a cane away from an old lady at the park. They're deceptively strong.,1.0
"My take... Probably messed some up...

1. The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side, so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane. This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass...
2. The phone is not evenly weighed, so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize, right...? Well, the same effect is observed when spinning a brick (it fell on my foot... twice... while I tested that) that I played around with. I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brick/phone is in the middle of the whole object, so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum, the spin is easier. On the other hand, spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy, so this state is unstable. The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate, which is a more stable state (rhyme unintended). The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out, which causes You to decelerate.
3. This one is a bit of a troll... I tested deuterium water and distilled water... and the distilled one produced no (less) effect! It’s not the water that is attracted to the cup, it’s the stuff in it (ions)!!!
4. The cereal contains some iron, which is magnetic. This makes it attracted to the magnet... Maybe, but what is interesting is that water and glass, fex, are pushed away by magnets... it’s diamagnetic! Anyways... Maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into? I did not observe one, I do not know, but I did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor!
5. Hot air rises. As the hot air creates a rising bubble, the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away. When it gets light enough, it slowly flies up...

First we glue every end of corner each other, then we make a little hole at the center by using a needle. Then we blow the paper from the hole until it expands like a pillow. Finally we light every corner of the pillow paper at the same time. It will fly and look like a Japanese fireball ghost in the sky",1.0
"Also, for all you would-be explainers: #2 works for perfectly symmetric objects in a vacuum.",1.0
"The reason why #1 works isn’t just because of the method, but because in the first case you only have one finger; the center of mass is always a point, and since you’ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane, there is effectively a 0% chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point, and thus starts leaning towards one side or another.

If you use the second method, there’s two points of contact, and thus as long as the center of mass is in-between, it cannot tilt. You can try finding the center of mass on your own, with two fingers together, without using the special method, and just doing it normally, and you’ll see it works fine.

TL;DR: You don’t need a special method to balance on the center of mass, you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between.",1.0
"#4 might have something to do with the ""4th phase of water."" It's a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to non-water surfaces. There's a charge-less layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bi-pole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along (and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out). I'm no expert obviously, but there was a Ted talk that I watched on Youtube on the topic which was fascinating. I suggest you look it up.",1.0
"First one works thanks to friction, when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal.",1.0
"On the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side, the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced. This should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed, the same force, and there isn't any other significant variables.",2.0

This study of photon-photon interactions is known as nonlinear optics. For example, two photons can combine to create a photon with twice as much energy. However, due to these high intensities not being common in daily life, this isn't frequently observed outside of laboratories.",1.0
I've been rewatching this for a while now😂. It's actually pretty interesting but I'm finding it hard to understand the leptons( especially the lepton numbers) symmetries and the neutrinos.

"A similar demonstration of the dropping magnet is a solid metal disk connected to a pivot so it swings through the jaws of a large powerful magnet. The metal disk is not attracted to the magnet, but when allowed to swing through the magnetic field its motion is slowed and almost stopped. If a series of closely spaced slots are cut into the disk and the experiment repeated, the disk swings through almost unhindered. The slots disrupt the currents needed to generate the opposing magnetic field.",1.0

"Truly a remarkable presentation!! I read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model, Fundamentals: The Ten Keys to Reality by Frank Wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation. There’s also the book, QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard P. Feynman which this video helps me visualize the x-rays excitements.

These all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to what’s left to discover?

Well I position myself towards LIGO Virgo KAGRA into understanding gravity and gravitational waves.

Of course education follows, but for now I am currently reading a booklet called Relativity the 100th anniversary; as instructed I have not proceeded further until I am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter 8.

We are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious. Even our inherent bias may get in the way, and like any puzzle, such as a sadoku, we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back, and finally, it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics.",2.0

"I had, and experienced, this same experiment in a high school physics class in 1959 as we studied pendulum motion. The teacher of that class was a PhD physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab. His demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe. Each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose. He asked each of us, ""Do you know the laws of pendulum motion."" Our response was of course ""Yes."" Then just as he released the shotput he said, ""Know we will see if you believe them."" Most, but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses. Only a few ducked away a the last second. That was 63 years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday. Sadly, today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment (or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom.) The lessons are to structured, preprogramed, and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students. Plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching.",1.0

His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistency/incompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way, and in a way which takes all of the apparent ""magic"" out of the theory.

I was fascinated to see that Roger Penrose uses Godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness, since I came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics. So cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man!",2.0

I think perpetual motion will be eventually possible.  Not by violating laws of physics but by tapping the fundamental forces of the universe instead of chemical fuels and such.  The only trick is deciding what k8nd of entropy to exhaust into.,1.0

On my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against Earth's gravity.  They can fly with no moving mechanical parts.  They create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards.  They don't defy physics though, rather they rely on well-known physics.  It used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground. There are more than 40 public videos of the craft.",2.0
"Amazing video thank you! Yes, atomic motion is perpetual. Mass changing its position in space = motion. Perpetual? Well for most of us billions of years is long enough. So, examples of perpetual motions (does not factor in wear and tear of the device); solar panels, water mills, wind mills, geo thermal (Iceland), John Bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts (I personally recharged hundreds of batteries, with carefully measured results)... The physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view, one device and what it does by itself. Yes that's being confined to thermodynamics. However, look outside the box for energy source (solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels, but from the sun). Thermodynamics is true in CLOSED or ISOLATED systems. Nitinol is also overunity (which perpetual motion is a part of) using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically.  The most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma (an electrically charged - ionized gas). Well, a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas, and they will be energized until the end of time by stars. Are we introverted into a small device set in motion, or are we scientifically, logically looking at the big picture? As long as we stay stuck in a boxed-in frame of reference, we don't progress. Every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically, from all points of view. Cheers!",2.0

"The trouble with the holographic notion is POV (point of view) on the one hand and photon density on the other, …… then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that can’t be “projected” and of course light speed. Having said that, I do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon, that being the interaction of matter energy with the Higgs Field at the plank scale. To my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space. So that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram.",1.0

So correct. A civilization can't only rely on an abstract science but on technology as well...,1.0
"What would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge God allowed us to know? It would be like we were contained inside of a realm, like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble. When pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble, like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle. God set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since He will always know more than us He has set limits on what we are allowed to know. But it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them.",1.0

The sun produces a lot of energy, and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight.

"It really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets. I just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university, and basically programming is not being taught to you (just very very minimally).

"When I started in Computer Science I was surprised how many of my classmates didn't even like to code.  They saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career.  My CS coursework certainly never taught me much programming.  My best teacher was my library of Plum Hall books.  In my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job.  The position was supposed to go to a CS grad student and I was an undergrad music major.  My research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition.  I was within a stone's throw of finishing my music degree when I realized that I met the requirements for a CS degree so I ended up graduating with a CS major, music minor even though I had 3 times as many hours in music as CS.  In my case I didn't program for long. Even though I enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction I went after graduating.",1.0
"TechLead this is a fantastic video, very well done. In my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science.

In math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis.  In physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card.  We programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data.

I started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph, and then it got too overwhelming since I was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week. I didn’t have enough time so I stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because I was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses.

"Pretty good summary! I disagree with the statement that it isn't a science, however. CS researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments. In fact, that's how I'm spending my winter holiday :) Like, ""If I solve this problem with method X instead of method Y, I get a more reliable answer."" Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it's been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are ""scientific"" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics. But some big, popular branches of CS like Machine Learning and AI advance primarily through empirical, rather than mathematic, evidence. Whether mathematics itself is a science I will leave to the writers of dictionaries :)",1.0

"It's been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree. Pay is amazing. Benefits are amazing. Flexibility is amazing. The projects are (usually) interesting.

I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world. At my university, computer engineering was 85% computer science, 15% electrical/electronics engineering. It's functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned. I chose to take robotics electives in school but don't actually use those skills in my job. I'm just a standard software developer/engineer. Haha.

I have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field, being the first target during layoffs and having to learn A TON of stuff that boot camps just don't cover. With some tutoring and some years of on-the-job training he is doing OK now, too. I'd definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer graphics, game development, distributed systems, and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry you're interested in.",2.0

"A good video as always! As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:

1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.

2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.

3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an ""off"" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off! There are also other uses for this state, but this may be covered in a future video.",2.0

"I was a Computer Science major but I switched to Computer Engineering last year. There really isn't much programming after your first 3 semesters in CS, after that it's all theory, which is great for the few that want to work in academia. Computer Engineering actually allows me to apply my learned programming skills to projects, whether inside or outside of class. This is why I made the switch and have no regrets!",2.0
"I’m an ex-CS and Math/Stats student, who actually just switched his double major to Actuarial Science and Maths/Stats. The reason being was because I found out that CS is only about 30% programming, the rest of it is theory of CS and various other theoretical, math-related CS courses like Advanced Algorithms and Theory of Computation (which I’m personally not interested in). If you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms, data structures, and theory of cs, as viable as it is, this major may most probably not be for you. If you love programming, but don’t find the in-depth CS stuff interesting, I’d encourage you to instead self-teach programming or go through a coding bootcamp.

"Here’s a story for you beginners , I went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding, I got a C in intro to Java, okay yeah I did bad but then I wanted to get better so I did some practice over the winter to improve my logic, okay B in the next highest class the following semester, Software 1. Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All I’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code, and don’t think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it else’s, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay that’s loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  I’m still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please don’t, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier.",2.0

"On the first point: I had been coding since 7th grade and I had plenty of classmates who hadn't coded ever when I started college. For those of you in the latter position, we don't judge your for not knowing programming. We are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you! I love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying. You don't need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you aren't a flawless coder, we aren't either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well, and we want to help you get to that point as well! We're all at school to learn, and if I can help others I will, I hope once I get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things! You can't be the best at everything

Also for the book thing, as a math major (double majoring), I have a nagging need to buy every book for every class. They are expensive, but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and CS textbooks in my room.

"Here is my story: I’m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year. I started off with the basics of C for a few months, then I moved on to Python (I’m currently a Python intermediate) and now I started learning Java. I think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects. I was fascinated by the cool games and projects I can create, and that made programming even more enjoyable to me. I would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club (as suggested in this video) because you can help each other out and build projects together. I personally wasn’t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code.",2.0

I loved this video I really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as I had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things.

"I've always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we, as humans, seem to sort things; it seems like we're much more efficient than many of the algorithms (at least the ones I've seen, which is admittedly few). For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. ""oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that's the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look""). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that's because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower ""clock speed""), rather than computational efficiency. Anyone know if that's true?

Has anyone made a ""human sort"" algorithm, so to speak, that sorts the way we do, including our little ""tricks""? (I'm guessing no). If not, are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two, like the one I just described?",2.0
"Just a few things to note about the ""big-oh"" notation discussed in this episode:

In industry, ""big-oh"" notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms. However, in academia, it is a bit more in depth. O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Ω(n) (pronounced ""big-omega"") is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Θ(n), prounounced ""theta"" (without the ""big"") is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.

Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is Θ(n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.

You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have Ω(n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values. This problem currently has O(n^2.3728639) which is the running time of an algorithm created by Francois Le Gall in 2014.",1.0

SHA was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures, but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords. For a password hashing algorithm, you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users. That way, an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing. As of right now, the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id, both of which were designed to be slow.",1.0

I've been stuck in tutorial hell for so long. At the moment I can code any mockup in HTML and CSS and Javascript is a challenge. I deleted every tutorial on my PC and decided to take this course. Week 0 blew my mind. The problem solving approach is what I love. It teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own.,2.0
"Strongly Agree... 
When I started my journey as a programmer. CS50 was my first course and I learned everything online from Net Ninja tutorials, W3schools, Clever Programmers, and so on.
Now I am a Mobile and Web app developer. 
Yeah, I can say it is possible to learn Computer Science without a degree...
And, I'm Self Taught Software Engineer too. Buddy",2.0
great video. as a beginner programmer i agree with most things you say. one unspoken rule of programming is to google *everything* you dont understand. its simply the only way one learns.,2.0
I totally agree with him. Before joining this course I couldn't even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious. But I attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest. So if you want to learn Python or Web or AI or CS  basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try. It's worth it.,2.0
"Yes, this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding. For anyone that's getting deeper into learning web dev stuff, I highly recommend Scrimba. It has a great problem-solving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what you've learned together instead of just showing you the solution first. There's also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it's very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor. You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code that's being written during the tutorial.",2.0
"First of all, congratulations, you've earned around 40 subs in the last 2 hours; from 12.9K to 13.3K! Second of all, I love your content and the  fact that you've encouraged me and many others to take this course is amazing. I've been doing frontend for 4 months now and sometimes I struggle with some programing concepts in JavaScript so...I'm enrolling now.",2.0
"I've been taking the course and I'm still on lecture 1, good to hear positive reviews, reinforcing my experience so far! I'll come back and update this when I finish.",2.0
"I started it a few years ago and went to week 2, but started working solo and never came back to it. 

I never stopped thinking about it, as the lectures are really great and their approach is very refreshing ! I will definitely take it again, back to week 0 :)",2.0
"I tried attempting Cs50 when I was 14. Man, it was a roller coaster. Some lessons were extremely easy to understand but some were hard for the small mind of a 14 year old. Fast forward, 3 years. I’m attempting it again and am currently on my 7th week :)",2.0
"13 years old. Long story short, took a programming elective, and now I'm here. My father told me that once I learn to program(specifically python) and learn some sense of web design and development, he’ll hire me (he's an IT director; right below the owner of the company).",2.0

Dr. Chuck is a legend!,2.0
"I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just ""programming"" or ""software engineering"". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving; developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into.",0.0

"Man, so much love for this series. Never has encoding or Unicode been so exciting!

Also, we cannot stress enough how absolutely REVOLUTIONARY it is for both our operations and the objects of our operations to be encoded basically in the same way.

"Programming can be incredibly creative and self-expressive. It's just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately. Like, it's unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want.

Also, problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally.",2.0
"When I took my exams so I can get in a university I really wanted to study architecture or art. However things didn't go well and my score was extremely low so I was left with a few options. One of them was computer science and telecommunications. And tbh despite the fact that I had zero interest in programming before, I freaking love this major so much. Sure it's hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works.",2.0
Andrew Tanenbaum books on CS helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,2.0
"My biggest tip: if you're a computer science student and have the chance (it was not required at my college) to take software engineering, make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because that's what you'll be doing.  Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing on the day to day.  You'll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what you're tasked with at work, but the software engineering portion you'll use anywhere you go.",1.0
"This is so informative, I've been a little on the fence about getting into CS but I love how challenging it is. 
This video really helped answer alot of question I had. I cannot thank you enough.",2.0
"Hey everyone, 
after some years of experience I know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills. 
A few days ago I had a very interessting, nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years.
The question which fascinated me the most was "" how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier?""
The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topic!Especially the following 2 questions would interest me the most:
1. As programmer, what are/ were the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with?
2. Regarding your programming skills, what would you wish for more than anything else?


Thanks so much in advance - looking forward to reading your answers!",2.0
"Thanks! Great advice! just starting out pursuing a BA CS after being out of school for 20 years!  I have been having a similar dilemma, I originally signed up for software development, but my counselor said I should do CS since I said I want the ability to be hands on, on top of developing.  Not sure if I am thinking too big....... but thanks great video!",2.0
"To hear that you didn't have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position. I really didn't have any experience with code, other than html, and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area.",2.0

"I go to ODU - so do you actually feel like you learned a lot in 350? I haven't taken it yet, but a lot of people I've talked to say it's massively outdated and just a ton of busy work. I understand that can help you practice discipline, but was it useful any other way in getting ready for your career?",1.0
"So my University currently has both Software Engineering and Computer Science. Both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes. For example, for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, there is CIS 350 (theory based) and CIS 3501 (SE side of the class) also the core requirements has SE majors take SE 2 after SE 1 while CS majors only take SE 1. So its really the same degree, same requirements, only difference is a couple of classes (that are very similar).",1.0

TSP is a NP hard problem but so is making this video. Every seconds of the video I see an exponential effort invested. Thank you so much!,2.0
"In the '80's, I used a different strategy to solve this problem, just for my satisfaction. I based my solution on the way Nature would create an inner expanding bubble until touching all the nodes with minimal tensional energy. I used Basic in an 80286 PC, with about 100 random nodes. A short program with less than 100 lines of code was enough to get satisfactory results.
Edit: minor grammatical correction (English is not my first language, sorry for that).",1.0
"From the Wikipedia page titled ""Ant colony optimization algorithms"":
""They have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems.""
This reminds me a lot of the YouTuber ""Pezzza's Work"" his Ants Simulation videos, make sure to watch that! It is analogous to the market, speedrunning, anything really.",2.0
"Been excited for this video for awhile. I’ve heard of TSP superficially many times.. but never got a deep dive like this before. Very motivated, exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated. Content like this is the gem of YouTube. 

Just to add: As impossible as this problem is.. it’s wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of 7.5+ billion.",2.0
"I'm quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach. I once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasn't familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search, and I simply wasn't able to explain the process. Well done!",2.0
"PSPACE problems, common in planning, are arguably ""harder"", as TSP is ""only"" NP-hard.",0.0
"I did a report in Linear Algebra discussing using Adjacency Matrices to find paths from any point to any other point by raising matrices to their power step by step.  I managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points.  Unfortunately it doesnt solve the TSP because it does not go back to it starting point.. only that it can hit every point.  We had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then ""lifting it"" and seeing the other points fall based upon distance.. we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes.. if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked.. unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all... to him TSP was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time.",1.0

"Congrats, Carrie.  You're officially my favorite non-Green-Brothers (hereafter NGB), Crash Course Host. None of the other NGB CC Hosts manage to hold my interest long enough to watch their stuff.   You've got a good mixture of interesting subject matter and a pleasant delivery style.  The GB's are both naturally funny and that works for the.  I feel like the other NGB Hosts try to be too much like the GB's and it comes off false.  For what it's worth.  Keep up the good work.",2.0

"Grace Hopper is awesome in so many ways but not for coining the term ""bug."" Bug, meaning a technical problem, had already been in use for several decades (1800's) so, as Hopper recorded in her journal when she taped in that moth, it was funny to find the ""First actual case of a bug being found."" It was a good joke after a long day at work dealing with problems, basically.",2.0

"This is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before:

I was a freshman data science major last year and I had never written a single line of code. I got a C in my intro to Java course and I was very disappointed as it was something I really want to pursue. I was worried about my performance in the next course Software 1, and if my grade would be lower. I worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and I ended up finishing with an A in the next course, and this was all over the course of one winter break! Now I’m making apps with swiftUI and solving data science machine learning problems in python! And this was all over the course of a year! Don’t be afraid if you struggle early on, it’s a part of the journey.",0.0
My advice as someone who just graduated with a CS degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that you're writing. Too many times I see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesn't work,0.0
"I'm in 4th year of my CS studies right now. Unfortunatelly, I needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own. I feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late. I just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining. I would say to all new CS students: 'This will be harder than you think. But the balance is the most important thing'.",1.0
I’m starting college/uni this year in the Computer Science course!! This was so timely🥺🥰🤩,2.0
"Another thing I've found helpful as a CS major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gen-ed classes (subjects like History, English, Philosophy, etc.). Having a spare 100-level ""Intro to X"" class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of Java/Python can really defray the pressure. Many of these are also just as good when taken online as well!",2.0
"Great tips! I would also like to say that understanding logic is very important. My professor really stressed this in my first programming class. He said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error. I think that he is right. Unless you can explain every single piece of your code, line by line, you don't really understand the logic behind it. 

In fact, he makes us go to the lab and the TA asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment.",2.0
"never say,"" I'll do it later"" when it comes to assignments and projects.
I'll write some more tips later",1.0
"Another tip is to take your time. Don't force yourself into like 5-6 classes. 4 classes (3 majors, one elective) would be your best friend.",1.0
"My advice: Get into your school's CS discords and class specific discords (if they have them, or make one if there isn't) . Graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot. Especially with what proffesors are good and bad, they help with assignments and even answer general questions.",2.0

"Steven, this video was awesome! You clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons, and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other CS educational videos. You definitely earned a subscriber",2.0
"I failed my precalc class my first semester of college. I did an easier math class the second semester and passed it. I'm ready to try the precalc again. Even though I failed the class, I learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Math is great. I'm not good at it by any stretch. I will still conquer this though.",2.0
"The reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard. It is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects. 
Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before, remembering a few equations like dates in history class, nor by just scrapping by. 
Office hours are the key to succeess, yes. But even more important than that, you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE, AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. THEN, YOU MUST PRACTICE, PRACTICE! 
Don’t study. Only practice. That way you don’t just know, you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS. Much like pointing out a particular color in the room, you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing (like identifying red + letters S T O P means ""stop!"") how to approach the problem and what equation, formula etc to use. Tools in a toolbox, Baby.",0.0
"Calculus, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra IS A MUST!!!",2.0
Lmao just changed my major to CS and was nervous for the math portion. Then I realized I’m not actually that bad at math and I was making it seem worse than it was. Don’t know if that will change when the semester starts but I’m excited! Gotta say thank you Forrest you’re the reason I felt confident in changing my major to Computer Science!,2.0
"Throughout my life I always viewed math as something negative and sucked at it. However, during freshman year of college I decided that computer science it is and started out taking basic math classes (pre-algebra). Currently I am taking Precalculus and will go up to Calc 2. What made me get to where I am is the mindset.",1.0
its important to note that it also depends on your college. some CS departments like the engineering department requires lot of math while others dont like arts and sciences,1.0
"Thanks for the video! Getting into my first math CS courses and it's been challenging, but you're absolutely right. Hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas.",2.0

Kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,2.0
"This is really cool! My only gripe is that it’s only 2 player local and not 4, when wireless and online are 4 player(although it’s likely frame rate issues), hopefully they add 4 player local in the future, but other than that the game looks like great fun!",2.0

Sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in Adventure 2. I'm glad they're taking that approach with Frontiers. I'm optimistic about this one!🤩,2.0
"It seems like they're actually going for a serious story this time! I hope they manage to pull it off. The cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to. I was pretty sold on playing this game but now I'm really excited! 
(Also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out. I guess it'll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later)",2.0
"Whether or not this Sonic plays out to what we want it to be, we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game! Looks great 👍",2.0
I'm loving the cyberspace stages and story so far. Nice to see another island in this trailer too! Can't wait to get this at Christmas. Maybe it'll be one of the few games I've 100%'d,2.0
"I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope they don't screw this one up. Like, I'd like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3D sonic game made by sonic team that's actually good.",2.0
"Beautiful, finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series, the first showcase was strange, but this one is definitely better compared to the old one",2.0
"I can't understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking, then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls. I don't understand how there's such a massive difference!",0.0
I always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game.,2.0

"The 3DS is probably my favorite system of all time. With access to all DS games and the impressive digital library, almost no other system library can compare. The library isn’t only large, it’s diverse. There are bangers for every genre of game. All of this is a portable package.",2.0
"I recently started playing Kid Icarus Uprising and, apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands, I am shocked with how much fun I'm having with it and I'm bummed that there hasn't been a sequel made since then.",2.0
"Love the 3DS!

Planet Robobot's true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games. Would be #1 on my personal list.

Great memories of playing Smash Run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else.",2.0
"Fire Emblem became one of Nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3DS. I don’t really play Fates or SoV anymore but I still find myself revisiting Awakening, love that game. If you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it",2.0
"I was surprised Kid Icarus: Uprising isn't on here. I think it's the best 3DS game. It's a true masterpiece. Yet again, Sakurai developed this game too, and a lot of his games are gold. He's a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games.",2.0
"3DS just felt so special. I didn't expect it but found myself really into Pokémon Sun and Moon. I think Pokémon Refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team, and I found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my Mismagus held on to the end for me. I know it ruins the game for some people (the Pokémon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band, apparently but don't quote me on that) but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost-30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game.",2.0
Smash on 3DS was a marvel in it's own right. The fact the 3DS could handle it AND at 60FPS on the OG 3DS was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,2.0
"My favorite series is the Dillon’s Rolling Western series. I remember going on the eshop to find The Last Ranger being advertised. However, I wouldn’t get it until I grew up a bit more. Dillon’s character stood out when I am already attracted to stylized games. 
All three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible. Currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop. Unless you live in a PAL region, those games will be lost to time.",2.0
"Kid Icarus Uprising is my favourite game of all time. The combat is fun, the weapons are cool, the characters are funny and layered, and the story and world building is fantastic.  It's been half the time there was between the last two games in the series, but I will gladly wait another 10 years to get more Kid Icarus goodness",2.0
"I know this will get overlooked, but I really wanna give props to the announcer, she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement, it honestly made me pretty hyped",2.0
"For those who didn’t notice, the store manager for the locker items is Harmony, a character that has actually been somewhat present before in the series. She’s part of the musical band known as Chirpy Chips that plays all sorts of battle music in Splatoon 2. If you look it up, she’s right there on the album cover!",1.0
"I love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours (opposite colours), for example…

Splatoon 1 - orange and blue
Splatoon 2 - pink a green
Splatoon 3 - yellow and purple

Some of the colours are slight variations such as pink, it’s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute",2.0
"For those who have questions about this Direct

1: you can actually skip the news this time

2: Salmon run can be played at any time

3: in Rainmaker there are multiple checkpoints now",1.0
I’ll always love splatoon. They never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted. I’m just really obsessed because I’ve always loved this game since I was little :),2.0
"whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise. everything was so easily digestible, and i’m glad new players can find their way even easier! she sounded so energetic, intrigued, and passionate overall. this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed!",2.0
"I'm going to miss the idols from Splatoon 2, they slayed, perfect character design, and wonderful personalities! I didn't expect we would get three idols, Big man, Shiver and Frye! They seem to have a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to doing story mode too! The gameplay must be amazing!",2.0
"I was genuinely afraid, I thought the game would be identical to the second, or even worse!  But this Direct definitely made me change my mind!  There are crazy news, the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games, and I love it.  New weapons, story mode that feels spatial, practically a free choice of character customization of much more!  I have no negative comments, the only flaw could be a short duration of the Story mode, which for lone players like me could be a problem, but I sincerely hope I'm wrong! 🐙",2.0
The expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans. Nintendo doesn't just cease to be awful. They don't know how to!,2.0
"The announcer here and on the direct is so good. She sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more.

I am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg

I’ve been a fan of Splatoon one but I didn’t get a hold of the game until Splatoon 2 cause I was poor lol
I legit can’t wait to play this every day.",2.0
"I’m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off. The concept sounds really cool, but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work, so I’m interested to see more",2.0
It'd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game. Because I fully expect digital merchandise to be abused/capitalized in some way out of favor for the consumer.,1.0
"For these kinds of shows, I think I'd prefer a rapid-fire series of announcements in 30-60 minutes, followed by a lengthier presentation going in-depth into specific games.

I will never underestimate a Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase ever again.,2.0
"This was far beyond my expectations. It was so surprising and joyful for me to see all Major Persona Games being ported on Nintendo Switch & also some New footage from SONIC FRONTIERS. I'll Never underestimate a Partner Showcase Direct Again, it was best of them all until now.",2.0
"This was actually a pretty good direct.

Good job nintendo! You surpised me!",2.0
"I am HIGHLY interested in the Megaman collection. Some of my favorite GBA games ever. 
Return to Monkey Island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice. I like the style but it's a pretty big change from what I'm used to seeing.
Kenta looks really charming and adorable. I adore the concept.
Dragon Quest Treasure seems like a real blast. I love being able to fight alongside companions. It makes me miss Dragon Quest Monster: Joker.
There's a lot of promise coming up but. Nintendo please. It was a huge 3DS hit. Please remaster or remake Tomodachi Life!",2.0
Nintendo just put out a better Sonic trailer than Sega did. This should have been the first trailer for the game. It makes so much more sense than the weird rollout Sega did,2.0
"This might be in the running for the best direct ever. So little downtime, each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing, to wow",2.0
"THANK YOU FOR FINALLY PUTTING PERSONA 5 ON THE SWITCH, I HAVE BEEN WAITING",2.0
"I do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai, stealth based ninja weapon. Diversifies the gameplay quite a bit.",2.0
"Well-worded and gracefully honest! It does like quite the quality title- I'm excited as a hardcore Splatoon fan. I have 670 hours on 2, so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years.

Of course, it doesn't hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel. I'm hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better.",2.0
The power eggs always had a use. You could buy weapons and upgrade them using the power eggs. Within the single player,1.0
"The graphics actually look a lot smoother, more intricate and more polished, as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement, which is super nice. I wasn't expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw, but now I'm happy.",2.0
"I wasn't really expecting any new formula for the Single Player & Im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned. Maybe they'll explore new things in the paid DLC

From the trailers I've seen & your gameplay, you get shot onto the stage for Turf Wars & Anarchy Battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas. Perhaps that's what made the maps feel bigger? Can't wait to see how they update the Splatoon/Splatoon 2 stages",2.0
"I guess in terms of a single player mode for Splatoon 3 I was hoping for a Bowser's Fury type of world where it feels more grand, some exploration and seemless transitions into the ""levels"".",2.0
"I feel like the biggest sell for Splatoon 3 is the timing. With the switch being as old as it is now, most people have a switch in their home. So for kids this is a big buy, especially if you haven't played it yet, but all your friends are playing it. I haven't played in a few years and I'm really excited. Just to chill, enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it. It's a lot easier to sell this game to a Japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out. As well as the IRL concerts with their in game idols.",2.0
"My biggest hope for splatoon three is to get it and have fun playing through the waves of content as they tend to be fun and hype as they come out, that being said for outsiders of the community I’m disappointed and really wish that it gives enough to entice new fans and not just old ones",1.0
I honestly hope it's great considering that Splatoon is my  personal 2nd favorite Nintendo franchise behind Mario,2.0
I am LIVING for the revolutionary joke. Gonna be giggling about that for a while. Great breakdown and honest feedback!,2.0
"This looks much better than the first wave, waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it.",2.0
"I remember trying to pass the first pinball in Waluigi Pinball as a young kid. The feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great. Definitely one of my favorite tracks. The pinball machine segment, the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it’s so popular.",2.0
"I’m literally hyped for this wave, they have Waluigi’s Pinball! I do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well ( like the sundae one), as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals. All in all, I’m excited",2.0
"I can't watch this without a huge smile on my face! Wave 2 looks incredible!

I still can't believe Nintendo is bringing back 48 courses spanning the entire Mario Kart series and updating them for MK8DX. It's like a dream. So many great memories with the originals! ❤",2.0

What I love about the Xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line. It hits different.,2.0

"This really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games, in terms of gameplay, art-style, and world features. I'm starting to really feel it!",2.0
This looks like the most complex battle system I have ever seen. Layer after layer of options. I am giddy after each function shown. i cant wait to play this. I will have to buy it and play.,2.0

"Questions:
Does the DRM appy to anything played on the Switch or just some upcoming titles? Do I need an internet connection to play on the Switch? Im always connected, so I had no idea this might be the case. Will DRM make the switch unusable in another console generation or two?",0.0
"This is part of why I stick with the older consoles. All these servers, network logins, and DRM stuff just ruins gaming for me. I just like popping the game in and playing.",0.0
"It will probably not be an ""online check"" DRM. I saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy DRM. Denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if it's running in an emulated environment. Based on their history using kernel-mode DRM / anti-cheat BS on the PC I would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo.",0.0
The thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more. I've had a couple of friends with RE: 8 on PC that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better. And for me personally. I bought the ultimate version of dying light 2. I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldn't handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter. I hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch. It will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases.,0.0
"It's also worth noting that the primary assumption behind DRM is that people that would pirate a game if there's no DRM would legally buy the game if there's DRM.  That's a really absurd assumption.  Most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all, so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer.

And DRM gets cracked in only a few months, so the pirates need only wait anyway.

DRM does only one thing, and that's punish the people that legally buy the game.",0.0
The eff is what I said immediately. Denuvo does not stop piracy! It kills game performance.,0.0
That's exactly what switch games need. Something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down. Brilliant.,0.0

Here’s our revisit review of Lego Star Wars with patch 1.0.7 - hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the Nintendo Switch version through our All Patched Up format! Mark,2.0
"The fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things I love most about your channel.  While I’ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do, such is the state of the gaming world in 2022.  You guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible.  Thank you!",2.0
It’s easy to be harsh on the Switch and the way some ports perform but it’s amazing to have full games like this on the move. When developers get it right it really sings,2.0
This is why I love this channel they don’t just abandon games at a review,2.0
"I suppose it's because I grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesn't really create a negative connotation for me with a game.  I know that if a game isn't wholly designed for the Switch that issues can occur with frame rates, pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games. I think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to.",2.0
"A note for your souldiers revisit, while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues, the fire temple, a late game area, is still prone to a lot of  crashing when saving at dragon swords, it was 50/50 every time I saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not, didn't get any crashes anywhere else so I'm not sure why that area specifically is so problematic (it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch)",0.0
I preordered this and I didn’t really notice much of the original issues but I think that’s because I was just enjoying the gameplay and I was mainly playing handheld on an OLED but it’s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,2.0
"Glad the performance has gotten better on split screen. I stomached it the first time through, but might return to mess around! Knew this game had potential on the switch",2.0
"There’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and I ended up quitting well before completion. I really like games with tight, responsive controls, where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set. This game was like the opposite to that 😕",0.0
"I nearly got 100% completion with this game. Had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief. It took a lot of patience, but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped. It was frustrating. Usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet, so you had to traverse large areas. Trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me. 

Now I'm stuck on some backlog games, so I don't know if I'll ever have 100% completion. But maybe one day....",0.0
"i'm so glad that the direction they're going with when it comes to ""chaos"" is pure expression and a sense of warmth, rather than falling into the trap of being edgy",2.0

"Whoever mixed this song is a genius. They managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time, and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great, all whilst making a genuinely slapping song",2.0
"don’t get me wrong, the concert vibe from the other games was cool, but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing!",2.0
"shiver’s part sounds like traditional japanese songs, big man’s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe, frye’s part sounds like it’s traditional from middle eastern, and the chorus sounds like samba. i’m in love with this song",2.0
"I love the music, but another thing I noticed is how different every idol’s dance was. They had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance.",2.0
The only bad thing about this song is that it ends.,0.0
"Not sure if anyone else had noticed this, but when I rewatched this again, I saw that the platforms that Shiver, Frye, and Big Man were standing on actually connect together.

I'm way more excited to see Harvestella than I am for Splatoon 3. So I'm happy they're going to show it off.,2.0

Very excited for PSVR2. Gonna feel like that big leap in graphics that flat games don't really have anymore because of diminishing returns,2.0
Not necessarily. If a September Direct came out in the middle or near the end of September it makes sense that it wouldn’t cover the already released Splatoon 3 and I don’t see  Harveststella gameplay coverage as something that would have gotten significant coverage on a general Direct either.,1.0
I actually like that you keep it real and don’t scream and shout. It’s gets a bit scripted and I feel some people do it for the younger audience. Which is like the equivalent of offering them candy to get in a van.,2.0

"Hmm... I'd still go with the Steam Deck. This is more expensive and looks like it performs worse. The only thing going for it is the OLED screen. Plus I think the Steam Deck will last longer, with it's powerful hardware and Valve's continued support. 
Plus I'm not sure how to feel about Aya Neo. They release a new console every 6 months, which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run. And they were WAY too expensive, and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the Steam Deck.
Edit: Should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything I said haha.",0.0
Just to note Gulikit also makes joystick replacements for the Steam Deck. I saw LTT install it not too long ago and recently picked me up a pair.,1.0
It's always a good day when a new Beatemups video is published,2.0

I dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well… but with options like the aya neo & steam deck i can have that! Love this new generation of portable gaming, it’s INSANE!",2.0
"Wood! Thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller (I know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck, but still)! I had never heard of it and I was looking for something like that because believe it or not, my pro controller/joycons all HAVE STICK DRIFT, so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what I needed especially when it's got gyroscope capabilities too! (I play splatoon, so I need gyro and sticks with no drift of course.)",2.0
"Honestly, that tricolour, three team mode was what sold the game to me. It's just a shame that it's limited to Splatfests only. I felt like as a mode, that was the truly unique and franchise-pushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel. Oh well, I guess Nintendo's servers wouldn't be able to handle it...

At the moment, this is just what Splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017, to me. Splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel (the tricolour mode was close to that principle, but alas, it's only limited to Splatfests) - otherwise ""Stay Fresh!"" is just a quote of sheer irony because Splatoon has, thus far to me, not proven to stay fresh.",0.0
The person who came up with all the fish puns seriously deserves a raise.,1.0
"The locker feature, the ghost feature and everything else looks so exciting! Can’t wait for this game!",2.0
"A lot of folks were hoping for an apartment they could decorate, and I feel like the locker feature is a good way to address that without distracting too much from the main game.",2.0
THANK GOD we can finally just queue up with friends on the same team. That was the main thing keeping my friends and I from playing more.,2.0

"Coucou :) J'adore tes vidéos, je te suivais au début par rapport à mes enfants.
Maintenant je me suis mise à jouer (à Splatoon avec ma fille !) et comme toi (car j'adore l'univers HP) j'attends ardemment que le jeu soit sorti !
Je crains néanmoins la sortie sur switch, peur que cette version sois moins jolie. Je vais me tourner vers la version PC je crois. 
Bonne journée :)",2.0

Je voulais savoir, si la version deluxe sera aussi au format physique pour l’accès anticipé de 72h, car j’ai fais des recherches sur internet et j’ai vue que l’édition collector a le droit à un accès anticipé.

Still happy with my original at the minute. I can't compensate paying for the upgrade personally. But fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer,2.0
It's a bit expensive and I didn't want to buy it as I have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early Christmas present and I was able to transfer and re download my stuff. Overall I'm really happy with the Oled version. It feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better. I was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so I say it's definitely worth it 🤗,2.0
It looks neat! The screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original Switch and the Switch Lite. I love playing the Switch on table top mode with the Switch Pro controller! It feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel!,2.0
"THANK YOU. You just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the ""its just a larger screen and that's it"" reviews that are bandwaggoning trash. So, thanks very much for this, you brought up a few things I didn't yet know about it! ☺",2.0
"Picked up on OLED and very happy with the bigger screen size. Paired with my Hori Split Pro joycons, its feels great...the stock joycons feel small and uncomfy. The screen for my old Switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel. If you have no fingernails, the cart door is way harder to open than the old Switch door.",2.0
Is it just me or was the original switch more creaky when holding it than the oled? The oled seems incredibly solid. Not sure if it just loosens overtime,1.0
"I have the V2 but I do think the OLED is nice. I like how it has ethernet support,and I hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well. I play only on my TV so I won’t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but I give the OLED a 9/10,def worth it for new switch buyers imo.",2.0

"Brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now.  I remember when I was very little, I had the N64 where I first played MARIOKART.  Then I was later given as a present the Game Boy.  And then I remember later on I wanted the GameCube which I got I think either for my birthday or for Christmas.  And that’s where I first played Animal Crossing.  I played the other versions on the other systems as well.  I then asked about a year or two later Santa for a blue DS Lite, and a few years later I got the DS i XL which was a surprise present from my grandma.  And when I graduated from middle school, my grandma got me the Wii as a graduation present.  I eventually also got the 2DS only because it was slightly cheaper and now I have the Nintendo Switch.  I still love them all and Nintendo to this day!  Animal Crossing, Super Mario Bros., MARIOKART, MARIO PARTY, and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day.  And I can’t wait to see Super Nintendo World when it opens at Universal Studios!",2.0
Thank you Nintendo for making our childhood memorable. I once owned GB Color and Nintendo DS and I had so much fun back in those days.,2.0

"Watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games. And after watching animal crossing and Pokémon streams I kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability. 
Now I think I definitely should save up for this one. I like bigger screen option and newer version. Can’t wait to see it available on local stores as I just discovered I could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iPhone 12. 
Also I see this as good option when you don’t have smart tv to play games on (like my friends) and I even looked up possible laptop connections. So this one looks right up to my alley.

"Apparently, it's because they're cheaply made. The parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile, and the buttons are suboptimal.

In other words, the joycons, while the optimal method to play the Switch in its entirety, are poorly designed for their tasks.",0.0

It was about downloading the DLC included with the NSO Expansion which is done differently than other DLC. And I'm pretty sure it came out to coincide with the new pack of tracks with MK8 Deluxe,1.0
The problem is it's not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the Mario kart tracks for example.

"Yo estaba viendo cada vez más factible que el Nintendo Direct fuese el día 1. Me monté la película de que Nintendo quería hacer eventos o dar noticias cada semana desde el Partner Showcase hasta el Direct de Septiembre y tenía la sensación de que el Treehouse era como su útimo recurso para cumplir dicho objetivo. Aunque, a saber, incluso siendo la  semana del 12, puede que sea cierto y estas semanas las completen con Treehouses de otros juegos como Mario + Rabbids o Sonic Frontiers.                                                                                                                                        Por cierto, se agradece mucho que también deis noticias pequeñas como la del canal de Sakurai.",1.0
"También el día 15 en la Tokyo Game Show, Capcom que ya ha confirmado su participación tanto presencial como online, retransmitirá ese mismo día a las  16:00h CEST , un programa online centrándose en títulos de la propia Capcom,como Monster Hunter(hablarán de la 2° actualización gratuita de MH Sunbreak, fechada para finales de Septiembre) y MegaMan , y luego el día 16 a las 17:00h CEST , retransmitirá un programa especial dedicado a Street Fighter 6 .",1.0
tengo entendido que lo que ya no se podra es añadir fondos de ninguna manera pero si se podra seguir comprando (si tienes unificados los saldos de 3ds y switch se podra comprar por sea caso),1.0

""Yeah, because you weren't paying attention back then.""
Easily your most cutting line to date.",0.0
"I really respect how Scott is a big Nintendo fan, but isn't fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgia's sake. So many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent Nintendo's way; being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be.",0.0

It’s been over a year and I STILL see Mario 3d all stars on store shelves,1.0
The fact that Balan Wonderworld and Breath of the Wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60$ makes me unbelievably sad,0.0
"I’m going to be legit sad when the Switch era ends. This is the last Nintendo console that came out before i graduated. I’m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy.
I hope i can have time for the Switch 2.",2.0
I’m seriously impressed how Scott can talk for over 2 hours and still keep it interesting. Even if I can’t watch it in 1 go I still come back to watch the whole thing,2.0
This was a joy to watch. I really like this series. Just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back. This year felt pretty monotone for me. I wasn't over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan PLA was cool but BDSP felt janky. Kirby was incredible. Kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though.,2.0
Can't wait! Cool to see some prolonged gameplay!,2.0
"3:19 Something I noticed that is SO small, but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping, they gradually skid to a stop. Amazing detail :)",2.0
"Is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains? I think Splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master, nothing wrong with that though! Can't wait to meet everybody in the turf war!",2.0
"0:48 New inkzoka looks cool, looks very strong and the 3 shot limit really helps balance it out a bit. My Question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of “triple spiral shot” that the inkzoka has, as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game. Would make for interesting ranked matches",2.0
"The specials are looking more aggressive than Splatoon 2's while not being totally OP like Splatoon 1's were. Eeltail Alley's looking quite well-designed for something so basic and open. The Stringer's looking like it could be more flexible than the old Chargers, but it might not have charge storage when morphed.

-And I'm calling it: the vacuum special's going to be called the Sucker Shot.- Well, that was a disappointment. And after they'd done so well with other names like ""Killer Wail"", ""Echolocator"", ""Bubbler"", ""Inkjet"" etc..",1.0
"I really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match. Not to mention, the music is HARD! Just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over!",2.0
"What I have gleamed from this is that I'll definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment. The specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions, and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes. 

I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered. It gives people a chance who normally wouldn't be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them. I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to long-ranged weapons when your weapon doesn't have the kit to contend. Definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple, because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you.",2.0
"I can’t even! This game is going to be so good! The added player titles, the new music absolutely slaps. And the new victory animations and just. Everything else.",2.0
"This gameplay is awesome, and I am loving the music being played, especially now or never, it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games, really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match, and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast.",2.0
I love the new display and gear. The new abilities fit the “City of Chaos” get up. I like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials. Can’t wait to see if they release a test fire.,2.0

"Donde anuncien un nuevo Mario en 3D para Switch exploto de la emoción!

Y también eso diría mucho de Nintendo sobre las intenciones que tienen con Switch, por que un Mario 3D usualmente sale a vender nueva consola , por lo que si lanzan un nuevo juego así,  me haría pensar a mi que no están pensando en lanzar una nueva consola en el futuro cercano. Muy curioso! 

Pero no importa, por mi esta bien por que adoro el Nintendo Switch,  sobre todo con los juegazos que están sacando últimamente.",1.0

"Perfectly said. I’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years, and I absolutely despise this double standard. You can love their games all you want (I certainly do), but Nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry. Stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them. This needs to be fixed not just at Nintendo, but everywhere.",0.0
Good stuff man. People being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet.,2.0
"When I was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to Nintendo of America and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was, and complementing your crappy drawings in detail. I think my Dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk. Those days are long gone.",0.0
"You’re 100% right. Everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on. Also, while we’re at it, let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate Kotaku, at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff.",0.0
Here’s a hot take: Most hardcore gamers/tech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos. This is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like Gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault and/or harassment 🤷‍♂️,0.0
"No new concept was added to my life with this video. Maybe it will help someone out there to see companies as companies, not friends.",1.0
"It's good to see that you're always willing to speak your mind. In a time where anybody that speaks up on anything, will be bashed and harassed for being honest. The direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad.  Appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother.  🙌",2.0
"I like Nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment, which happens in too many places. Men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others.",0.0
Congratulations RGT you’re finally learning what trends are. It seems Nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like Activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered.,2.0
I miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace. Characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game’s challenges.,2.0
"Congratulations Nintendo, you did it.  You added what should have been there in the first place.",2.0
"Thank god the queen of Mario sports/party games is finally here, Daisy deserves better I absolutely love her! 👑",2.0
"Daisy should have been there from the first, but I am glad to see more than a single character in these updates

2, a stage, and gear. It's exciting but it also means my expectations were very low",2.0
"I do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else. If all the dlc adds new stages, gear, and characters, then I’ll be coming back to this game for a long time.",2.0
"It’s about time Daisy came to this game, she should’ve been here from the drop, I am so hyped",2.0
This is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one. I want to see MUCH bigger updates in the future,2.0
"I'd never argue with new content entirely, so I'm grateful and happy they've added what they added here. I think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity, it would need to have a Spectator Mode and possibly proper 4v4 Online (where all players can be remote) so that there could be a tourney scene.
I myself would be hosting them regularly with a Spectator Mode client, but it could go eSports if they had a tournament scene like that. But like I say, I'm happy for any additional content being added to the game and I hope they'll consider modes/features for the updates to come!",2.0
You guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release.,2.0
"Good to see them adding in more stadiums too, not just characters",2.0
I dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves 💜,2.0

"I'd like to see a 4K docked and 1080p handheld successor to the Switch that's backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics, online and frame rate too.",2.0
What I need going forward is a Nintendo Switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games. I need to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps. I just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed.  Of course this would benefit many other games but I haven't NG+ XC2 because I am hopeful I'll get to re-experience improved on new hardware.,2.0
"I actually feel Nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the Nintendo Switch level. It's the perfect system whether you want a home console, portable or both. They should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks. I'd also like to see more things the Switch could be paired with ..like linking to discord and Spotify and having them run in the background.",2.0
"Graphics do matter... but it's more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented. I don't care about SUPER REALISTIC graphics, I just want stable eye-pleasing visuals with amazing gameplay.

Look no further than how poorly some of the earlier 'realistic' graphics have aged on previous consoles, while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless.",1.0
"Given Nintendo's track record with moves that make sense, they will use this feature sparingly as they did with cloud gaming and file transfers.",1.0
"It must be difficult for nintendo to decide on how to move on from the Switch.

I would like to see the next console (hybrid hopefully) support switch cartridges still.",1.0
I wonder if No Man's Sky coming to Switch in October will incorporate some of this 'new' tech we've been seeing more of. Seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the Switch. I'm still really curious to see how it turns out. Likely will either be a pretty solid 30FPS or 30FPS with frame drops and low res. I suspect the low rest automatically in either case but I never played the game so I'm interested to possibly give it a try if it's a half decent port.,2.0
"I still love my Switch, but after owning the Steam Deck for a couple of weeks I have to say - Valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the Steam Deck then Nintendo is the Switch. I've already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then Nintendo has in 5 years. Nintendo needs to take a page out of Valve's playbook here.",2.0
"I’d love to see Monolith apply this tech, either FSR 1.0 or DLSS when the newer model drops, in an update to Xenoblade Chronicles 2. All the Xenoblade games are in my ever-growing backlog, so I think I’ll wait to see if this actually happens 🤞",2.0

Personally I’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging. I appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run.,2.0
"While I really have no plans to get a Steam Deck, I'm hoping that a little healthy competition for the Switch will make Nintendo step up their game with the next Switch (or with some sort of Pro model like the fans have been crying for for years)",1.0
"The Steam Deck is an excellent friendly competitor. Nintendo's advantage is many great first Ip and tons of third parties. Not to mention name recognition, but the stream deck could make Nintendo focus on creating a Nintendo Switch Pro or Nintendo Switch 2 that has more power which I think is great because it puts more pressure on Nintendo to do better.",2.0
"I think fancy premium packaging would be cool, but I like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses.",2.0
"The packaging feels really nice and Valve-like. They made it simple and homey (if you get me) and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the Switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant. The outside doesn’t matter, it’s the inside that matters; this couldn’t be more true with the Steam Deck!",2.0
"While the Steam Deck's performance handling these AAA games is impressive I'd really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects. The Steam Deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try PC gaming and it really has so much more to offer.
Where I feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known, smaller, and past titles.
(Basically pick any random, old, game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rerelease/remaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console. Older games often look much better on smaller screens too. So many should be fantastic on that little thing.)",2.0
One of my favorite uses for my Steam Deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console I've always wished the Switch would be!,2.0
"This is the best Steam Deck I've watched - even out of all the tech youtubers and video game channels!

I doubt we'll get any new announcements anytime soon and I don't really care about indie games they're all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about PC feel like they should work more on xbox and not PC and I have PC but that's me,0.0

"He specified ""One Box exclusives"", in the market those exclusives are necessary in order to get subscribers, if all the services are the same there won't be no point in services, it's like with Netflix and Diseny +, exclusive content but that is allowed to come out on Blue ray from Disney, but not on Netflix. Same thing for services.",1.0
I love how some people are missing the point of his statement. He literally means “one platform” Xbox been doing this for years and now even PlayStation is slowing doing it,1.0
You're constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content. Thank you 💯,2.0
"I think Phil is referring to games coming to PC and mobile. As for Xbox games, it means the same but also where ever game pass is too. I seen a lot of PlayStation fanboys acting like Xbox will go 3rd party and all Xbox games will be on PlayStation",1.0
"Console exclusives aren't going anywhere. They would be insane to split market share off of their hardware, their ecosystem and ultimately their control. Nintendo has dominated both Sony and Microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the Switch. They are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform.",2.0
"Destin, I think I enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument. To the issue of exclusives. I think the strategy of MS has already been spelled out. 

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.

But I personally do not think their games will go to Sony consoles like most people tend to think because Sony are their competition.",2.0
"I think it's a time of wait and see. Imo, we're seeing all these investments because interest rates are low. If at the end of the process, Sony for example don't see financial gain, I can easily see it reverting. We're all hoping this works as gamers, but none of us know what the end result will be.",1.0
Phil Spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming Bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new he's staying consistent.,2.0
I would love to boot up my console and swap from Battlefield to Halo to Spiderman to Mario Kart to Pokémon within the same ecosystem but I just don't think something like that will happen unless there is a third party neutral console that has all the subscriptions for each major player on it,1.0

What do you think about the FUTURE of console EXCLUSIVES? Thanks for watching and LIKING the video! <3,2.0
What would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then?  We might as well have a one console nation.   No competition or reasons to buy different consoles.   Exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console.  There’s a reason Netflix has different movies from HBO Max.,1.0
I believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives. Companies like Nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms.,1.0
Xbox says “game pass is the future…. Because we have it”….then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”,0.0
"I disagree. Console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart. If exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a PlayStation, Xbox or Switch. Everyone will become a PC gamer. 

In a perfect world Sony, Microsoft & Nintendo will join forces and Sony will engineer the hardware with Microsoft’s wallet and ambition for higher specs and Nintendo’s passion for innovation. Unfortunately, we don’t live in such a world.",1.0
If all games were on one console that would eliminate competition and create a monopoly.,1.0
Considering how well Nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the Switch I find Phil's comments laughable,0.0
"I have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives. I get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform. This coming Phil along Xbox's track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up, haven't exactly been praised as PlayStation's have been, this is more corporate weasel words. 

Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises. Halo, Gears of War, um...I'm sure I'm forgetting some others. The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption. 

Xbox has doing really well with Game Pass, but they are missing that killer app for the system.",0.0
"Ok 1) Phil is right as far a exclusives go. Because they are also on pc. So there will be no exclusives. 
2) multiple devices references pc, tv, phone, console. So no they DON'T NEED SONY'S CONSOLE FOR SALES",1.0
"Meanwhile nintendo: Hell Nah, not me or my son.",1.0

Also absolutely thrilled to learn that Lies of P will release day 1 on Game Pass, one of the few benefits of owning both Consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds.",2.0
Lies of P looks incredible also Dead island looks like it could be good High on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads.,2.0

High On Life is Conker but as a first person shooter I''m hyped for that game. Lies of P is the successor of Bloodborne. Callisto Protocol looking good. Sonic Frontiers I'm impressed. Atlas Fallen and Dead Island 2 oh yea! 👍,2.0

Thanks for watching! What consoles do you currently own?,2.0
"Just bought the series S. It looks great, loads fast and plays next gen games. I'll upgrade in a couple years when the series X is easier to find. It's worth it people",2.0
Series s is PERFECT for PlayStation players who want to expand their gaming library. After getting my ps5 I wanted a cheap way into the Xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that I honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price,2.0
"The deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when I've amassed a huge collection of physical discs. That's why I got the Series X. However, for anyone new to Xbox or someone who doesn't own physical discs, this is a great purchase.",2.0
"I've owned both and the Series S has a special place in my heart. I love the X but unless you're rocking a TV that supports 4K120 w/ VRR, the Series S is just fine. Also, it's SO tiny and it's amazing what a quiet beast it is. But definitely buy the storage expansion card, regardless of which one you buy.",2.0
"The Series S is plain amazing, especially with GamePass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming. I've just completed the entire Gears series on 360 because I never got to play them back in the day (Gears 1 to Judgment) and it's been a pure blast. You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost (including Xbox and Xbox 360 games) so there's that too. Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS. Yes my last name is Spencer how did you know?",2.0
The only next gen console I could find was this one. Have owned it for about a year. 0 regrets. Would buy it again. Its amazing. Its form factor blows my mind. So tiny but so powerful,2.0
I definitely have no complaints with the Series S. From what I've seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console.,2.0
"I was totally blown away by my series s 
I still can’t believe what you can get there for 300 bucks
Still I upgraded to series x because I’m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money 
Still I would totally go for the series s. 
It’s super quiet performance is mind blowing And it’s pretty small 
I guess this time Xbox is superior to PlayStation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new Xbox consoles though they’re way better 
X is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer 

I didn’t expect to be that happy with Xbox after being used to a high end pc",2.0
"needless to say that the Series S is actually easy to find and purchase, while getting a Series X for not more than original retail price is difficult",2.0
"Xbox just announced the Xbox Series S as a suprise, so unfortunately it's missing in this video! The price is also announced, $499 for the Xbox Series X and $299 for the Xbox Series S! What do you think, will you buy the Series X or S?",1.0

The Sony exclusives are the one thing that I’m missing on my Xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol I think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise .,2.0

"My 1st console was the original PS.  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2.  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me.  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives, strategy, and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power.",2.0
Honestly for most people it comes to whatever your friends have,1.0
I like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,2.0
"You quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play.  That is a win for the Xbox, because it has direct integration with PC.  You can chat with anyone on PC, but also directly play with them in a slew of GamePass games that silently support cross-play between PC and Xbox.  Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).  No brainer, Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience, including online.",2.0

I was once in line at a GameStop to buy a used PS3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his PS3. So i bought the PS3 off the guy for less then what GameStop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store. We both won on that day.,2.0
"As someone I used to work for GameStop, my advice is to always buy the Used system over the Refurbished ones. The refurbished ones were broken at one point, and whoever fixes them doesn't do a great job.",0.0
"I was a manager at Electronics Boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the PS2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate. I told my staff to unpack them when they came in, immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out. We had gotten burned too many times, and I wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore.",0.0
"I sold my Xbox One X a few months ago (on eBay), and whew... this video makes it seem like I really sold mine for far, far too cheap!  I'm one of those people that keeps everything -- including the foam wrap, plastic bags, and twist ties -- so the console looks pretty darn good once I get it all back together.  I can imagine that the only reason you'd want to buy from Gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong, and familiarity.  Also, they don't know me, but they know Gamestop.",2.0
"I worked at GameStop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs I’ve seen. The first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in; it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out. I bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way. The second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes. With these consoles, very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold.",0.0
Something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off,1.0
"I used to work in a used game store. We would refurbish GameStop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month. GameStop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn, and using the cheapest replacement parts available. We had a local GameStop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did. So much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any GameStop console they purchased within a week with proof, for $10. Fuck GameStop",1.0

"Gamepass is such an amazing service,i mean at first it was ok but NOW and next year …WOW!Can’t wait for all these games to release day one!!",2.0
The reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger. None of their past games have had an open world. Their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations. In this game it's actually one open world so it's the largest open space of any game they created. And they did say that this open world is bigger than Prey.,1.0
"There is no ""loop hole"" for how Death Stranding made it to Game Pass PC. As some have already commented, 505 owns the PC rights, so they're free to put it on anything they want. Sony owns the console rights to DS, so this is why it will probably never come to Xbox consoles, unfortunately.",0.0

Well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they ain't planning any new additions this yr we should be good.. honestly it's not a big deal for me personally 🤷 I run both xbox series S and X which honestly its been more series S than the X. And ps5 so I'm good on games lol 😆 dude I have thousands of games already on both platforms 🤣. So yea and atm I'm back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake. So I'll be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on GP I'm ok and I'm sure many of us are.. xbox has been really good to us ya know. They take a huge hit just for us to have fun and that's why I love xbox. They truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series S and X and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it. Yeah games on Xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with Game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series S n X...  and i don't understand why ppl are shit talking the Series S.... dude I love mine I have 3 of em 🤣 🤣.  And it can do 4k Microsoft already said it does lmao.. and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your TV go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your TV or monitor does.. and then start a Game... and then take the TV remote and hit the OK button.... your TV will tell you what the series S is putting out to it... mine shows 4k 60hz Hdr10 DD and the games look beautiful and smooth.. yeah it's not as nice as the series X but it's Def not 1080P it's a higher resolution 100% and I don't see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol.. 1080p don't look that damn sharp n good lmao... and just look at the ps4 pro specs... the ps4 pro is a 4k correct??.... well the series S has better specs has better hardware... the same or a Lil more Tflops as well... the series is is a Zen 2 which is a AMD 3k series a RTX machine... it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the X...,2.0

"Excellent repair.  

I few years back, I did a repair on a computer with a broken SATA port.  i replaced the port and the system ran fine.  A year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasn't working.  I'm like 'okay'.  I asked did he want data recover service.  He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something I'd done.  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders.  I said to him that his system didn't even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it.  He mumbled something and said he'd just take his business elsewhere.

I know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists.  But I have a serious question to people who'd just be regular customers.  If you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem, would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free?  I'm hoping this question doesn't come out as snarky or sarcastic.  It's a sincere question I'd like to have answered.",1.0

"When a game says their new game is bigger than their last game, The people whining saying ""A bigger map means the game wont be dense!"" Are just complaining to complain.

I guess I am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous. If the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least... Then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some BS comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much.

"I think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially, when you look at the number of studios Microsoft has been acquiring, and with fewer cross gen titles limiting Devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles.",2.0
"I’m very happy with my Series S, and I’ve been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but I’ve just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didn’t really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, I’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, I’ll get one but for now I’m really enjoying my Series S",2.0
As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,2.0
"I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. It’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. There’s a lot that goes into this stuff. 

Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. I’ll be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then I’m 200% sure I’ll feel justified with the purchase.

Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a second… I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that can’t even keep up with my old 4K tv.",2.0

"In your own words: ""Do I really want an XBOX? No. Do I really need an XBOX? No. But I feel like I work hard and I deserve it."" In reality, since the day you stepped onto the XBOX Series platform, you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didn't really want, that's foolish logic. The next time you don't want something, don't buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it.",0.0
"I don't have a Series X yet, and although Series S is a great console, the fact is all digital is a no go for me. The reason is that I have a good collection of XBOX 360 and XBOX One physical games, and some of them, such as older Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to  license issues. So the only way of playing those games is using the disc. I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive, but as this is not an option, I'll have to go with the Series X.
Another point is that, although GamePass is great (I had it for two years and experienced great games, including Halo Infinite), I think it is a bit too expensive. If it was $80 per year, as the Live Gold was, it would be a no brainer, but at $15 per month ($180 per year) I think it is too expensive. You can use that money and buy over 7 AAA games on physical or digital sale for that price (assuming an average cost of $25 per game).",1.0
"I bought a Series S when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription. Was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games.  So I decided to sell the S and buy the Series X. Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadn't turned on my series X for a week. And before that it was just sporadically. So decided to sell.  BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.  Going to sell that,  which will make my Series S end price probably around 60 euros. Can't get better than that!  For casual gamers,. like myself,  the Series S is a fantastic console.",2.0

"These next gen consoles should've shipped with more storage to begin with (especially considering they're backwards compatible with last gen). But atleast Xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device.

If you don't mind moving games. I'd suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive (like the Sandisk Ultra Fit). You can easily fit 2 on the back USB ports on the Xbox giving up to 1TB of more storage. While still having room the expandable SDD too. Plus you can play the older Xbox One games off the flashdrive.

Sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive. However using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space. Meaning it's easier to fit in an entertainment center. Plus it makes it easier if you move your console often.",2.0

"Let's look at this from a consumer point of view, paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing. No big deal, that's just how the business is. Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console. But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get. And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry???? 🤨🤨 Talk about the pot calling the kettle black 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣 Sony has no answer to gamepass, there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they can't go anywhere else. This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD. But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat, and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldn't leave COD multiplatform. It's apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for Sony 🤦🤦🤦 hypocrisy at its best",0.0

"IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)",2.0
Its quite obvious to me that Sony fears Microsoft.  That's why they keep blocking games from going to Xbox. What the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play? Grow up Sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing .,0.0

"to be honest, unless you have a TV that can do 4k 120hz there's no point thinking about the future ""Pro"" versions. 4k 60hz doesn't push the Series X so no point upgrading if you don't have a top of the line TV.",1.0
"I really wish they would beef up the storage on the S for it's current price. A 1tb XBOX X is the same price as an S with a 1tb expansion, makes it way less appealing. Granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the S. Overall I feel if it wasn't for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture. As it stands there's not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel. Hopefully production ramps up for PS and XBOX so we can leave last gen behind.",0.0
I see a lot of comments from people upset about next gen games not really happening yet...we can't really blame Microsoft for that though. We have to look at the devs and ask them why they're continuing to support older hardware instead of trying to focus on the newer ones. Most likely to due with the limited availability the last couple of years but still. Now is the time they should be focusing on Series S/X,1.0
"I would say that the best thing about the XBox2 (AKA Series S/X) are the memory cards.  They're convenient & swappable.  With the size that AAA & even some AA games are coming at these days I view them as essential.  With the PS5, I'd have to get, at a bare minimum a 2 TB which ISN'T swappable.",2.0
If we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing.,2.0

"I feel you on the cost of the pro series controller. I have one of the series 1 pro controllers (which I bought used) and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel. I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there, because Xbox doesn't offer their own replacement parts, which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue. To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isn't going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time. The paddles are nice and all, but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from S.C.R.U.B. for less and get the same functionality out of it. But hey, to each their own. What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab. I would pay extra for that, but as it stands right now, I'll stick with my standard series X controller 🤷",0.0
"I'm beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the Initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger, more experienced studio from the get-go. Maybe they had plans to do this originally with Certain Affinity? (as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the Initiative from the earliest days... most likely on a prototype)

But it looks like Gallagher went with his old studio, Crystal Dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier Initiative hires. But is it really that surprising? The Initiative wasn't hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive AAA project... they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead. And even Jeff Grubb once succinctly put it, 'Perfect Dark was never going to be made by the Initiative'.

Pretty sure Gallagher and other high-ups knew, if they were going to make an AAA game, they were always going to need a large & experienced studio to take on most of the work-load. Trying to get that done with a 65-75 person team isn't realistic.",1.0

I really wanted to love it but I couldn't warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues.",0.0

but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the ""free to repair"" thing, but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision, so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it, id be all in favor of it!! that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that !",1.0

Also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates, but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling. It isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60, but it might allow a stuttering, inconsistent 30 FPS to hold a more locked 30 FPS.",0.0
I hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well. We need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the Series S as the base for optimization going forward.

Hope to hear about F4 casting. They’re going to need the two years. They have to complete the cast and complete the writing then shoot then reshoot (as they do) and then get a teaser out months before the release of the film. Heck they announced captain Marvel and Brie Larsen over two years in  advance.,2.0
"We all knew Marvel was going to save the good announcements for Disney+ day, and D23. 
 Can't wait!",2.0
"They could introduce a group of Mutants that has huge ties to the X-men, especially Wolverine. Bring in Alpha Flight and at the end have a cut scene of Heather and James on a hunting trip and encountering a wild beast in the woods. They don't even have to show his face, not revealing who the actor is. This could lunch into the X-men Movie where Xavier is  recruiting the new team to battle Karoka to rescue the original team. They could do flash backs for the first half giving us the true original roster. I always fear that the X-men movie will feature the more popular members rather than establishing the original 5 and later Havok and Polaris. I don't mind having the most popular members, but stay true to the originals. Hated when Fox screwed it all up. And Rogue WAS A VILLIAN before joining the X-men.",1.0
"Much in the way they did with Spider-Man, It does help to have Fantastic Four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows. That allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do an(other) origin story for them.",2.0
"We are just so blessed to be living in a time where there’s so much Marvel content… I’m a huge fan man! Been watching for a while now! I’m very grateful for the shows, movies & everything the MCU has brought us! Thanks for keeping us in the loop as always! You’re the 🐐",2.0
FF needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure.  Thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villain(s) will be.  I do like the idea of the Squadron Supreme / Sinister from another universe as mention in Mr. Roman's previous posts.,2.0
"I'm stoked for F4 casting. And while yes it's 2 years away, it was also announced in 2019, so they've had 3 years to cast it. And I'm willing to bet they had it cast before Watts left the project. And they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing. It would make sense for them to show up in Quantumania.",2.0
Sounds like a pretty solid lineup. I can't imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what. But I guess we'll see.,2.0

"The thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas. I love seeing diversity, it’s a wonderful thing, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation. Just write good stories and good characters, it’s remarkably simple.",0.0
"It’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk. The cgi looks terrible, the marvel humor is painfully unfunny, and I’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes, I’m not watching it simply because it has women in it. 

You hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation. Nobody cares about the character’s identity, people only get annoyed when the actors, directors, and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re MLKJ’s successor. It’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product. 

Same thing with their messages. Sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist, but they do a terrible job of conveying them. Also I don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race, religion, gender, ethnicity, panders to intolerant international consumers, has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them, does business with oppressive governments, and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance.",0.0
I’m a huge marvel fan… can’t wait to see each project. This was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated! I was hoping other people were feeling this too… it’s bizarre:(,2.0
"As an Asian who was actually born and brought up in Asia, I had never felt issues watching Western shows and their ""flawed"" representation. I mean if I want to watch a local movie I would just watch one from my own country, as there is no way Americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves. This is until I am being lectured about how representation works and how happy I should be watching Americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them. I mean seriously, you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the world's Chinese? That is patronizing as hell, because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese, China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world. Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard, yes I am from Singapore.

I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever, if not forever. Tried to watch Dr Strange 2, but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake.

If you want a good representation movie in recent times. Try Everything Everywhere All At Once. Great representative movie, not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story, showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background, plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life . I mean they even represented rocks, who else can top it?",0.0
"When End Game was on the horizon, I remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make Captain Marvel kill Thanos and single handedly stop his army. So thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise. The MCU ended with Endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of Phase 4 feminism.

Though Spider Man NWH was just a one-off great movie for me since Tobey’s spidey was the first movie I remember seeing in theaters.",2.0
"It sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters 😔 Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly, like you said, these new characters lack any character growth and as such, I don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable. I just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters. Also I just discovered your channel and I love your content 🤍",0.0

I will say Bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything he's been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga, but I'm glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself :)

(I understand this is about introducing Jennifer to the MCU but If we don't get a little of Bruce's backstory, perhaps provoked by Jen making a remark about childhood stuff I will riot! /J )",2.0

Bruce banner was abused as a kid, watched his father figure beat his mom to death.  Bruce tried to off himself and failed.

"*Description of exclusive video footage:*

1:10 - Panel starts with a Sizzle reel narrated by Stan Lee. ""Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the world right side our window."" Footage from previous films plays: The Avengers, Infinity War, Black Panther... ""Today is our time."" Phase 4 titles start to be included. ""Welcome home,"" declares Vision. All three Spider-Man land together. Disney+ shows cut by with new heroes being included. It culminates with Clea opening a portal, Professor X, Thor landing, Matt Murdock catching a brick, Kingpin, more shots from Phase 4 movies and shows. The Illuminati, the Eternals, and more. Right at the end Miss Minutes jump scares the crowd.


10:40 - *Official Trailer | She-Hulk: Attorney at Law | Disney+ (YouTube)*


13:43 - *Secret Invasion* footage begins with a shot of a field as a beam of light opens along the horizon and a silhouetted figure resembling a classic grey alien emerges. As the figure gets closer, it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury, looking pretty grizzled after his time in space. Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar. She tells him that she’s been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years. Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back. “This is different,” he says. 

In a montage, we get quick glimpses of Talos encountering a group of evil Skulls, Emilia Clarke shooting a gun, Kingsley Ben-Adir multiplying into several identical forms in a confrontation with Fury, and Olivia Colman talking to Nick Fury saying “You’re in no shape for this Fury.” We also see Rhodey being questioned about his security detail and a shot of Martin Freeman as Agent Everett K. Ross. The trailer ends with Talos asking what the Skulls want from Nick Fury and Fury declaring, “I’m the last person standing between them and what they really want.”


19:18 - *Ant-Man: Quantumania* footage opens at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, where Scott Lang is reading an excerpt from his new memoir, titled Look Out For The Little Guy, to an enraptured crowd, including a beaming little kid dressed in Ant-Man cosplay. He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him, but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter, Cassie. As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds, Scott’s phone rings, and the caller ID tells him that it’s the SFPD, leading him to remark aloud, “Why is jail calling?”

After Scott bails his daughter, Cassie Lang, out of jail, they are seen eating dinner with the Pym/van Dyne’s (Hope, Hank, and Janet). Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help, and when Cassie says that she is trying to “do something that matters,” her dad reminds her that he “literally saved the world.” This comment receives fake shock from everyone else, who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before, and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it. Shrugging it off, the Avenger retorts, “You’re all welcome for all not being dust.”

Voice over narration from Kang The Conqueror begins, ""You're an interesting man Scott Lang. You've lost a lot of time. But time isn't what you think. It's not a straight line."" This dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device, which unexpectedly turns on. As it powers up, it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave, and Cassie gets sucked inside of it. As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her, he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast, landing them in the Quantum Realm. 

In montage footage, The characters wander through a trippy sci-fi landscape where they run into Bill Murray, who is wearing a kind of fantasy robe. He seems to recognize Janet van Dyne. We also get a glimpse of MODOK. Kang’s voiceover continues, explaining that he knows how everything in Scott’s life ends. Scott responds, “I don’t know who you are, but you’ve made a big mistake. I’m an Avenger.”  The footage ends with Kang stepping out of the shadows, ""You're an Avenger? Have I killed you before?""


23:31 - *Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3* footage begins with Nebula piloting the ship as it is captured by Ravagers. She tells them to stand down as they have an appointment with Gamora, who is now leader of the Ravagers. Gamora appears, wearing all black and looking super tough. There's a shot of Peter Quill on his ship, looking sad. Peter reflects back on their time together. ""You were everything to me,"" he said. ""I thought you were gone but you're here and I miss you."" Gamora tells him that person was not her. 

In a montage set to ""Do You Realize"" by Flaming Lips, we see the Guardians in colorful spacesuits, leaping into space, the evil monster from the beginning of the last film, Peter and the team getting off in what looks like an Earth neighborhood. Nebula is helping to put up a sign in what appears to be a business district with alien writing. There's a flashback to a baby version of Rocket Raccoon. We get a look at Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, who has gold skin, Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary, and Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog, played by Borat’s Maria Bakalova. Groot fights back to back with Quill, now fully grown and even more bulky, muscular, and tall than in the original film. There is a shot of the team in their classic blue uniforms with red trimming from the comics. 

The Guardians are bounding across an alien planet. They’re each wearing brightly colored suits, each one different: blue, green, red, orange and yellow. Peter tries to talk to Gamora about their past. He asks if she might be willing to open herself up and she says “I don’t think so, Quinn.” Peter corrects her “Quill. It’s Quill.” At which point Mantis tells Peter that they’re on an open channel and everyone can hear.  

The footage ends with the Guardians all walking in slow motion, Groot, thicker and more muscular, no Rocket, and Gamora slightly off in the background.


58:21 - *Marvel Studios’ Black Panther: Wakanda Forever | Official Teaser (YouTube)*

The montage/action in most CGI scenes I feel use so much motion blur that they're just...well...blurry. There was a bit of that here, but overall it's becoming more naturalistic. Dig it.
Eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the ""need"" to add every frame between the movements for smoothness, when there isn't much smoothness AT ALL to eye movement. They did a good job with the eyes for sure. 
This has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video, but just throwing in 2 cents ; - )",2.0
She actually uses her audience-directed powers at the very beginning of the show for the first time imo- when she’s about to leave for her trial and then turns around and says to the audience that “we probably want to know about all the hulk stuff first so you’ll actually be interested in the lawyer part of the show” or something along those lines,1.0
"Watching this, one thing that may have been an easter egg that I only remembered from this episode was the court drawing of She-Hulk with the weight lifters.  As a teenager, I had a poster by Joe Jusko of She-Hulk at muscle beach.  Maybe the court drawing was a nod to that?",1.0

"No its not an A or even a B rate movie.....the core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing , to analyzing what was going on around the world AT THAT TIME  and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile. I will not criticize their reactions , too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie. Instead , they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness. Im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers , ill admit that , ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbers...and theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more.

"You hit a soft spot with Ronin.  I think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed.  The acting, the dense sub-text, the camera angles, the story progresses while revealing nothing.

Awesome",2.0
"Penelope is actually a really great movie. My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times. If you haven't seen it you should and I have to say it's a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others, or if you're child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like. And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be. There's a lot to learn from people of all ages. Watch it!!",2.0
"Great recommendations list, Darren. Ronin and the car chases, awesome and has a great plot. Silence Of The Lambs; just a superb horror. Agree that Anthony Hopkins is on his finest day, with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Just received my latest Universal Yums, from Czech Republic, today 9/23/2021!!! Many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation. Take care ⭐️⭐️⭐️",2.0
"These movie reviews are always good, and largely because they are honest. If a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed,  the reviewer still tries  to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc. It's a very democratic approach. Always a good job !",2.0
"I recently watched ""Hackers"" again and realized that it's a really good pairing with the original ""Tron"". They both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary, just from opposite sides of the screen. Great performances from a great cast in both cases. They are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after Al Gore opened up the internet to everyone.",2.0
"One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material, in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The film respected and captured this incredible book, & the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, with Jonathan Demme directing, made it a masterpiece. Some movies you sit and watch.  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you.",2.0
"While I generally agree with your comments about Ronin, the callous disregard of collateral damage - shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents - was a total turn-off for me. They spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion.",0.0
"I just watched Post Mortem on Netflix last night and really liked it.  It's from Norway and has only six episodes in the series.  I'm not sure how I could describe it - horror? (a little); comedy? (a bit); police procedural?  (I guess...some).  It was just really strange and (at least to me), very entertaining.  Also, I watch all foreign movies with sub-titles so I don't know if it's dubbed or not.  Anyway, check it out!",2.0
"I'm sure you've seen Malevolent from 2018 with Florence Pogue, but if you haven't it's just a really well acted horror flick.  I seem to like just about everything Florence Pogue is in.  Thanks for another great list as I plan to check out Primer and Troll 2, both of which I never would have considered without your recommendation.  Pls keep making as many of these lists as you can!!",2.0
The Revelation behind this movie is so divine. A great Applause for the Production of this movie.,2.0
"movie title is ""THE BLACK RIDER:  REVELATION"".  It is an ""After civilization falls survival film"" of fairly good quality.",2.0
Wow!!! I loved this! Can't wait for the next one!!!,2.0
"Woo...!,this movie is inspirational most especially the last part where the little girl died I really love that part and there's a great lesson there.
Big thanks to the writer and all who put work to make this movie a success🙏😍💖💥",2.0
"This is not Black Adam. This is Black Rider. Totally different movie with totally different actors in a totally different timeframe. Black Rider is a good(ish) movie, though.",2.0

"I know that you have other things going on, but I seriously miss the regularity of your videos during the height of the pandemic. You, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, Marion's Kitchen, Nicki Positano, and a few others are what got me through the days (weeks!) of quarantining alone and food shortages. The fridge in your old kitchen gave me hope that I  could shop and cook for good food and make it work in my ancient undersized fridge. At the same time, I was unemployed just before the pandemic. I'm now employed again (yay!), but I miss the regularity/frequency of my favorite YouTube channels. Best wishes!",1.0
I can’t tell you enough how excited I get every time you release a new video. I’m actually making your infamous stew today ….and probably this chicken Piccata recipe tomorrow 😋,2.0
"The video was only posted 5 hours ago and I already got off work, went to the grocery store, made it, and am eating it as we speak. And unsurprisingly ITS GOOD!",2.0
I've been in the mood for chicken piccata for a while so this has just solidified my grocery run for this evening.,2.0
"What I like about no breading or flour is it's less bits left in the pan to possibly burn --- I could make a nice sangwich with this and the sauce as a dip. 

Hakuna Piccata",2.0
"The editing is topnotch!! Oh, and the food looks incredible too!",2.0
Alison!!! 💖🥰 I absolutely love watching your videos. This looks delicious! Definitely a recipe I’ve gotta try. I was looking for a really good chicken piccata recipe and here we are! 😁,2.0
"I love you, Alison! Can’t wait to make this, this week and I hope it’s okay to call you this, but you are truly my favorite chef!!!!💖💖💖",2.0
"Thank you so much Alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes, even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata, I really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them! Your twists bring the dishes to a next level!  

I am very sorry for the abuses (micro-aggressions) that you had to endure in your profession. I had no idea what the word ""Chef"", said it in that context, meant. But I know, from my own experience, how even simple words/statements can actually be aggressions towards other people. I have felt that many times in my profession too (which has nothing to do with cooking, btw!).

Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses, they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether. On the contrary, you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us. Thanks again.
Never look at yourself through the eyes of the joyless!",2.0
"wow I'm so proud of lil mama. She did a great job playing this role. It really captures what goes on every day in the hood. I cried, laughed, and my heart was touched. I know so many ppl with similar situations and I am thankful someone is bringing it to light.",2.0
"This movie really taught me more than I already have known, I'm a young girl trying to start a new life alone after all the trauma I strongly believe that all shall come to end.... This movie also got me a bit emotional too but indeed Is a life teacher, i enjoyed and recommend that it should display movies in different contents cos it's inspirational",2.0

Wow this movie was raw...the fact that she lied to majority of the people she spoke to about her kids because she was ashamed says volumes. This was wayyyyy too good for free on YouTube but I'm glad it was.,2.0

I've seen this a dozen times.  The opening does a great job of setting the scene of absolute loneliness in that town.  You feel the sadness along with some of the characters.  A longing for times passed.  A stirring for something new.  Damn good movie.,2.0

"The finest movie ever. All that you cant resist. All that parents taught me, all I adored, all that and more.",2.0
"The film is set in Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie (Phyllis Love) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child ""Little"" Jess (Richard Eyer) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet goose causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh (Anthony Perkins) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.

We are introduced to the family via its youngest member, ""Little"" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.

The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer. On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.

When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a ""Reb"". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence.",1.0

I completely agree with you about Thirteen Lives! I watched it the other night and I wasn't sure I was going to make it to the end. It was so intense and I felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it. Unbelievably fantastic movie!,2.0
"Better Luck Tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films. As an Asian-American, I never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad. That viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist, in my opinion. What, we can only have roles as nerds, straight A students, martial artists, dutiful sons and daughters, etc? This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did. Sure, I wasn't dealing and stealing and whatnot. I was in all advanced classes and band. But I also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties. I felt seen by this film. I may not have always agreed with Ebert but I will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time.",1.0
"I wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them. I'm a big fan of classics including the likes of Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, William Powell, etc. I used to be able to watch them on YouTube, but they've pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement.",0.0
Thirteen Lives was incredible. It's exactly how we as human should be behaving.,2.0
"I really liked Bound! It shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie. 13 Lives was good also. I watched Marathon Man when I was too young to get into it or understand it, I recently watched it on Prime.",2.0
You could not have been more spot on with Thirteen Lives Darren. What an amazing film! Incredible. Thank you as always for the recommendations.,2.0
I always appreciate the work you put into your reviews. I feel that you’re very thorough and honest in your opinion. Thank you for what you do. JCVD is an amazing movie. Very hidden gem.,2.0
"Another killer list! I've said it before, but check out Birdy for one of Nicolas Cage's earliest movies, and 'Hector and the Search for Happiness'. Both are terrific movies.",2.0
"13 lives was an excellent movie! I remember hearing the situation on the news. I didn't realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out. 
Drowning/ suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  this movie.  It was so so good.  Great even.👍👍👍👍👍",2.0
"I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie. But Saif doesn't look innocent at all throughout the trailer. R Madhwan's smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie.",2.0
Vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor I have seen in south industry n r Madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece❤️,2.0
Krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster 😂,2.0
"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app",0.0

"Hey KRK , you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest. Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ✌️✍️",1.0
"3:13 hilarious review 😅🤣😂😅
I am Pakistani and I always wait for KRK videos, by God big fan KRK bro
I watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review, also I'd say KRK's viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views, everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news, so he deserves for views, like and followers.

"A small detail from that Kelly’s Hero’s scene is when the Tiger tank traverses the turret, the engine could be heard revving.
The Tiger turret was was hydraulic operated which was powered by a mechanical drive from the engine. Increasing the engine RPM would allow for hydraulic pump to increase speed allowing the turret to traverse quicker.",1.0

"This was immensely enjoyable, we need more with Loremaster Moran!",2.0
"The main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making. Although independent thinking was encouraged in the German army, the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf. The tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving. He also has the ability to kill all of those Shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position. Essentially, the commander is a tool.",0.0
In fury it infuriated me that the German tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the Shermans. The tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,0.0
I love how accurate his interpretation of Batman's Tumbler was. He says it would only protect from small caliber rounds and something like a rocket propelled grenade would do serious damage. That is exactly what we see destroy the tumbler in The Dark Knight. The Joker uses an RPG in an attempt to kill Harvey Dent and takes out the tumbler in the process.,1.0
I'm trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because I know every generation goes through this stage. It's like an infuriating rite of passage.,0.0
Im trying not to get too annoyed with Janelle and Lucas… but seriously don’t judge CLASSIC movies if you haven’t seen or just by small clips. At least the other four aren’t rude or saying negative things. Give the movies a chance because you may actually like the storyline and the messages behind these movies,1.0

Balto is a legend. His statue in Central Park proves it. He raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit Alaska. He ran in a blizzard for 8 hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive. A true legend.,2.0
"It’s not so much the fact that they don’t know these movies that makes me mad, it’s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad! 

People worked hard to draw those films, hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation, and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up.",0.0
Lucas and Janelle needs an attitude check and respect.,1.0
"As always, Jaxon and Anthony are so funny together by just being competitive. 
Jayka and Danny have good chemistry, too.

One of the reactors though was too snobbish against these classics. Wait till you become older and realize that some shows this decade would be considered cringe in the future, too.",2.0
"I get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them. I get not liking the quality. But Janelle and Lucas’ entire personality throughout this video is “let’s trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it.”

“bUt tHEyRe tEEns” No. the other teens in this video were great and open minded. Other teens in real life are very open minded as well. These two don’t pass the vibe and I wouldn’t want to watch anything old with them.",0.0

"Great video! As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production. The work that you do can also vary by company, some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization. I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested!",2.0
"it was a great overview of all the process.  it would be great if we get more videos on DATA PREPARATION, EDA. various methods
for different scenarios.",2.0
"Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned! THE FIRST TWO STEPS (ACQUISITION AND CLEANING) ARE SO IMPORTANT!!!!!",2.0

"I found this video to be very well done!! When I begin work on a new model, I always start with a Google search, and go from there. Unfortunately, you can't do this during an interview. I feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked, all the time, just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper, and build out a model. I've been in the data science world for the past 10 years, and that's 10 years of proven success. If that's not good enough for you, writing code on a blank sheet of paper won't help very much at all.",2.0
"This is very helpful, thanks for putting this together :)",2.0
The biggest problem I’ve had so far is working with my manager. We both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right. We are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003. So he’s an old head and I recently graduated. It’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,0.0
"I'm learning Data Science and whenever I read job descriptions for entry levels or even for Interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 2,3 years of experience. Plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services. I mean it feels like they're demanding an Intermediate Data Scientist and terming it as ""Data Analysis Intern"" or ""Junior Data Analyst"" role. This frustrates me a lot.",0.0
"Yes there’s ambiguity in role definitions. In my previous company, I worked as Data scientist. However I hardly did any data science work. It was more like a developer work where I was assigned to test and deploy the ML models in production. I could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services. Trouble shoot real time issues. But did little of ML. Then I changed my job and joined as Data analyst. Here I do little of analysis, SQL etc and more of ML like developing models and fine tuning them. Cleaning the data, feature engineering and feature selection. 
I would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science, what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project. They lack quality data, if they do have data- accessing and compiling the data is another issue. After aligning with multiple departments as single man army, you are expected to give some magical results. When results are satisfactory, you will be asked to deploy them. Here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing. Somehow you drag the project. Later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production. And then after all of this single man army efforts, management doesn’t see any value in it. Just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution. They are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it.",1.0
"I feel like tech jobs always morph: we have hiring expansions and more specialities, then we have layoffs and more generalizations. It does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff, but I’ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills. Thanks for the video ☺️",2.0
"Great insight! I got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so. The fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for. It felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science, data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for. Plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees. After I got a role, I left after a year and transitioned into SWE as like you said the expectations didn’t match the reality plus I was also at a toxic workplace. I realized that I want to be in a role that is more well-defined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later, I’m not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements.",1.0
"thanks for sharing your experiences! The manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists (a category I wasn't aware of before this video) was odd to me. So he was saying that there wasn't enough data science related work for a full time hire (or else he wouldn't be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer). I can imagine companies having this need (smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats), but if I were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist, I'd avoid this manager/company! I actually left a job in the 90s for this reason--I was being pulled into other jobs/tasks that weren't related to machine learning, so I left and joined a company I could do machine learning full time (I'm an old guy!  I predated data science, so in that time, it was called ""data mining"" or ""pattern recognition"". and yes, I'm using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though I know they aren't fully interchangeable). 

The manager is key--even if you like the company, if you don't respect or are respected by your manager, it will be an awful job. Remember that when you are being interviewed, you are also interviewing them! :)",1.0
"You covered some really great points that I'm also experiencing in my current role as a ""data scientist"". Tbh I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing and it makes me feel so lost especially since I'm still early in my career. I saw 2 great people leave the team to work as a data engineer and a software engineer. It's absolutely demotivating to see people leave. I'm also looking into transitioning into a more data engineer and/or product analytics role but the interview prep is super overwhelming/difficult and imposter syndrome really kicks in. 😢",1.0
"Its really difficult to work as a Data scientist because every company have different expections from Data Scientist. And now a days, a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision, deep learning, Operational research, Machine learning, SQL and many more. There must a  discrete line between data scientist work roles. And also as you have mentioned interview prep, it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch. — Struggle of a DataScientist",0.0
"Preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a Data Scientist role and Data Science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people. You only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a Data Analyst or ML Engineer or Data Engineer when the interview doesn't circle around what you'd imagine it to be. But that's the reality and thanks for pointing it out.

And most of the time I am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role. I could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me. Such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in Data Science because often times it can be misinterpreted.",1.0
"In my personal experience the harsh reality also included:
1. Studying all the time, to the point that you personal life gets affected.  8 hours of work and 4 hours a day  of just keep up with the new lake, cloud , software, technique, library , bi tool etc. 
2. The feeling of ""You don't know enough"", ""You are not enough"". You briefly mention this and I am glad that  I am not the only feeling the same way. I know python enough to do my job, but I am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch, or change between languages say from python to  java or R. I use the existing libraries and move on to the next project.",1.0

"Great video Shane! Completely Nailed it. As a data scientist myself, I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were.  On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren't challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams. The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they aren't liking the position at hand. I love seeing the data and trying to map it to what I'm hearing anecdotally!",2.0
"I loved the remark about how if/when data scientists' jobs get automated, either the world would have ended, or world peace would have been achieved. 🤣",2.0
"Excellent, data-driven assessment of this field.  I am 57 with a BS in math just retired (not really, want to work in data science) and pursuing a masters in statistics.  I have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty. Most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens.  I was able to start on Zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although I keep fit and positive (I never lied about my age - that would be creepy but didn't need to advertise it either so long as I pulled my weight in study groups).  I feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best I can.  You mentioned ageism and while I have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet I have experienced ageism and how one's ""value"" can diminish at a job.  The brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating.  Me, I'll keep on going until I cannot.  I enjoy turning data into knowledge.  I am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos.  Either way, keep the data and its interpretation flowing and ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light!""",2.0
"I’m a data analyst 
I will say, you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set
One wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money
I’ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned",0.0
"Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well.",2.0

"Great video. I'm a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position, so I have some ideas on the markets for both jobs.

In my opinion, the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed. Those folks oftentimes won't even get past the HR screener.

There's so many new data science and analytics Master's programs that have opened up, along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable (statistics, computer science, economics, physics, etc) that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview. Even if you have a great portfolio, the HR screen is not even going to look at it.

However, if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics master's degrees the job market becomes super easy.",2.0

"Shane, I would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information. I looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science. Usually people will go into something like Business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale. Also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs. For instance in IT career questions even though IT may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of $15-$20 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin.",2.0

Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills.",2.0

"I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. 

I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for ""automation"" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.

For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.

Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree",2.0
"Personally I think you hit one key point: the importance of domain experts.  With the so-called automation or new technology/ tools we'll likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs.  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesn't mean he/she can do data science or machine learning -- or more importantly, to put out anything meaningful or even useful.  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.  If you pay attention to some of the podcasts like ""me myself and ai"", most the guests (chief data scientists or boss of DS departments) aren't really of these backgrounds but more business driven.",1.0

"Working as a PhD in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data... and it always shocks me how little they know. I'd say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it (that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem). 

My understanding are the best skills to have are 1) be able to identify problems 2) be able to decide how to solve the problem. Once that is done, usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial (though potentially data cleaning is time consuming). But honestly, don't trust me. I had to go do a PhD because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff...",0.0
"That's the point.
For example, I work as BI Analyst, normally with Power BI, SQL and low-code platform (PowerApps, Automate...)
I have a Master in Data Science and I know how to built Neural Networks from Scratch but...for what?

instead most of the tools which I work on, have integrated machine learning tools, as image recognition, NLP, classification... with a few steps and a clear suscription.

In fact, I get my job because they demand for a person who knows analytics and have data science knwoladge so that can advice on the use of these integrated tools.

"Asking if Data Science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying. There will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers. Tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that. But just like engineering and medicine, most people who think they want to be in the field can't really hack it (for whatever reason). If you are someone who is smart and hard working, you don't have to worry about the field being ""saturated."" Most of that saturation is from people who aren't very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two. There's a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world. The wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly.",1.0
The whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more,2.0
"What a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science. It is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that DS is actually evolving and diverse. It is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health, business, banking etc in respect to the application of DS in it. Thanks a lot Thu Vu for your resourceful info.",2.0
"Data science is extremely saturated at entry level, just ask anybody who's applied for a data science job in the last year. Moreover, data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data, but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost. If you actually want to work on AI projects these days and not just be a data analyst you'll need a PhD in computer science. 

Also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering. As data science tools continue to be democratized and automated, software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills, as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role, so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part.",1.0

"Very informative video! I agree with many of your points, and I'd like to add some of my own (I'm a Lead Data Scientist at an American unicorn):

1. We don't really care about your background as long as you can code (SQL and Python), understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ML models. Your education might limit your progress later on, but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entry-level data scientist.
2. Communication is _really_ important. We expect all new hires to be good on the technical side, so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high- and low-level is how well you can understand what's being requested and what's important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business. This is the number 1 thing I mention to my reports during 1:1s.
3. Many Data Science courses (BAs or Masters) don't teach SQL, or if they do, it's just basic stuff. Regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be, SQL will always be essential.",2.0

"If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job, if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job. 

Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)

In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have

For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes

I have been in both, my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years.

In hindsight, this is really great advice. How about them apples.",2.0
"Great video Tina! Loving the minimize input maximize output (MIMO) series. My step into the world of data was from a non-technical (biology) background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts. I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects. I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem (that helps to make a positive impact in this video) which at the time was a novel thing. I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it, topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in. Your persistence through 200 SWE roles is very inspirational 😆",2.0

I feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop. My two sister's worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up. Sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses. My sister's lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state. She then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze.  Actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times.,0.0
"so as a technician I worked at a dealership (two actually) owned by the same guy. He has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy.

"Since I was little I knew I’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do. Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5% increase every year just sounds insane to me. I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them. Took countless 70+ hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup.

1) own something
2) try to make it a monopoly (either legally or physically, e.g. tie it your personality)",1.0
"This actually makes a lot of sense. The company I work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealership/racing team owner. The owner of the company isn’t a billionaire, but is in a position where he can throw around money whenever he wants.

I'm a mortgage broker. He's completely right. Except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business. Sure you can compete but you can't steal my referrals which supply all the business. Offering a Lower price is a poor tactic unless it's purely how to learn how to run the business,1.0
"Depends also on what you define as rich. I don't mean that in a philosophical way either, just that living standards vary greatly from person to person. If you need to have a mansion, a yacht, and 5 or 6 super cars then it's a much greater challenge. Also, what are the time horizons? Is your goal to be ""rich"" before you turn 30? Or can you wait until 45? or 50? Because something else they didn't mention in the video is investment, compounding interest, passive income, etc.",1.0
Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.,2.0

"Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities.",2.0
"The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party.",0.0
"As a student in Data Science, in order to automate those tasks, AI needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off.",1.0

"Hi Priya- thank you for this video. I am concluding my last year as a student receiving my BS in data analytics. And I have so many questions that are causing me anxiety. As I am nearing the end of my journey I have realized that the path in computer science ( DS/DA) is not structured like one probably imagined it would be. What I am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools (Python, SQL, tableau, R,) if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them,  but the real challenge starts after graduating, in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights ?

Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs? I have beginner level on all these programs right now but I feel like I probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until I’m at least intermediate in SQL and at least Python, for starters. I would appreciate your feedback, and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible. Congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science.",0.0

"10:00 this is an extremely hard coding task. It deals with a custom data-type, implies the iteration and verification of the end. I wasted 40 minutes and didn't resolve it, all the solutions I have found, include flattering with a separate method, than iterating and len() verification. And the task is formalized in a way, that next() and hasNext() methods should be enough to do the flattening (which is again more difficult).
I am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune-500 company coding interview. Comparing this with the ""explanation of the gradient descend"" is like chalk and cheese.",0.0
I’ve just concluded my bachelors in Civil engineering but I am inclined to move to the Data science field. During my course I learned how to program in phython(in Spyder) and SQL and I’m still updated with those skills. Imagine you are in my shoes what should I do moving forward to learn more about data science? and ensure I can  get a job at it? Do you think it is necessary to take another course? What are the general technical skills I have to master?,1.0
Great video!  I appreciate the honesty.  Did you start as an analyst before moving to a Data Scientist role?  What role would you recommend for recent grads?,2.0
"A scientist who works in data science has been a godsend. Finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications. After weighing my options, I chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science. Before seeing your videos, I was baffled as to why I continued being turned down for jobs despite having two master's degrees, one in physics and the other in applied physics. Now that I've seen some of your vids, I understand why. Glad I found your channel on YouTube:)",2.0

I've been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since I started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role, that's just the goal I have in mind and you just revealed to me that I don't exactly NEED to become a software engineer first if I can land myself to a data analyst role, the hierarchy showed me I can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal.. you are a god send.. :)",2.0
thanks man for clearing this up... especially in India ...all IT companies have made a mess about Data jobs...why don't you make a video dscussing these JDs ...especially from India....? these all are MNC's,0.0
"That's a very nice explanation, I'd love to see each step in-depth",2.0
"Companies nowadays prefer a generalist over a specialist who is super expert at one specific field only.

Could not answer it right away, but got the to the answer after a couple of mins. I asked the job interviewer if anyone ever got it right after immediteatly and he said only one, but he did not hire him. So don't worry question aren't everything, its got more to do with the way you handle the situation with dignity and without being a liar.  Also keep your head up, iwrote hundred of applications and still ended up at a big corp.",1.0
"I love your videos! I had one quibble about your SQL solution to #1. If some publishers have more videos than others, then their video durations will affect the mean. You could imagine one publisher with 10,000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos. In this case, the average duration of that one super-publisher's videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers. I think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages. (of course, this detail may not matter in an interview)",2.0

"Maaaaaan, the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable, despite of its level of complexity. You make it sound, somehow, easy. Not because it is, but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own. There are many out there who put themselves on a superior position, maybe caused by their formal-education ego, but for some reason you must follow their same steps, which means you'll never be as awesome as they are.

The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information.

"I have been a data scientist for three years. As a data scientist, one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in. The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interest/domain of expertise. Moreover, companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science. It's better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise. Hence, I'm leaving data science and starting my PhD 😂",1.0

The Data Science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we don't know how things will pan out in 10-20 years down the line.",1.0

"OVERVIEW:

1) Study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you.
2) After you a role, study the JD for that role in various companies & check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role.
3) Go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role.
4) The coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn.  Studying the theoretical/ conceptual part first is suggested.
5) After the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data
6) Work on a project ( Kaggle is a great place to start)
 
Nope we're not done here:

7) Prepare for interviews
     (solving problems in a limited time frame  under a pressure setting)
Tip: Do as many moc tests as possible under time constraints.",1.0
"Hi Sundas! I have a career in auditing and over time I ended up focusing on producing data models by pulling data from SAP ERP.

These days, this work is often done by data analysts. It requires knowing the data base and handling analytics tools (SQL, Script, Python, etc ...)
I am learning Python and I am preparing for the CAP (Certified Analytical Professional) certification, to learn the methodology and accredit my qualification.
After listening to you I think I should prioritize statistics.
With my experience I think that I should orient myself towards business data analytics. Thanks for the info.",1.0

"This video is really good and legit. I do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age. There are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free. The learning process to build an entire game is long, and difficult. Especially if you're thinking of an rpg. In my experience, single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience, multiplayer games are a stretch to even try(alone or with a small team). But don't let the reality beat you up. If you really really want something, you can make it happen. I've been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years, and have prototyped/concepted my own rpg 5 times. Only now in 2022, am i confident enough to build the official version. But I've done it. I've learned enough to make it happen, and you can too. (Knowing is one thing, then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life).

"Solo Dev here, and the part about marketing is totally true.  My game (SHAMELESS PLUG, LINK ON MY CHANNEL TRAILER) was a complex effort where I learned a lot about animation, music, and sound mixing.  Some seemingly simple things, like sound settings and zoom, took the longest during development, and when it was all over, people who played my game said it was pretty good, but it was hardly even seen by anyone.  The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.  If anyone's wondering how accurate this video is, the answer is somewhere around 120%

Great video too.  Editing was great and music was well chosen.",2.0
"I come from Indie to AAA studio as game programmer. 
If there's something to add, every discipline has it own depths on knowledge, perfecting stuff like design pattern, design principle, code conventions, CI/CD pipeline, Automate Test, etc. (for programmers) is needed when your project grow. That come along as other department.
Maybe at the first time you think you won't need dedicated Project Manager that handling all daily task and scrum, but when project get larger, team gets bigger, you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation. Heck, if you love making games later on you won't even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on. 

If you just started game dev, make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear, will you create your own studio? or work for big companies? which discipline? what studio ? (this can be matter as a programmer / artist who need align their technology / artstyle).
There so much to prepare and I can't write all of those question in one post.

Hope everyone who read this post can consider your journey even harder, not make you scared of gamedev but thinking more critically because this could be your future work and huge part of your life.",1.0

"The most important thing I took away from my programming professor is: if your code is doing the thing you intended it to, that's the right way to do it.
Don't get hung up on 'doing it the right way', you can always optimize later",2.0
"It's two different things; to start learning and to make your first serious game. When you start learning, if you go straight away to make your ""dream game"", it will likely be frustrating, because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game. Creating a copy or a ""remake"" of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn. When I started learning Unity, some years ago, after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a ""remake"" of Duke Nukem 3D, using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender, this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project. It took me, I believe, 6 months to finish it, it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game, and yes, it played terrible and nothing like the original. But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot, I don't think I could have learned faster other way. Another point I would mention is: learning to code: I think was the most important thing I did. When I started making games my game ideas were limited to what I imagined I would be technically capable of implementing, after I got a good grasp of coding I feel and I know I could make anything I can imagine, given the time to do so.",1.0

1. Polygon! All meshes are made from polygons. Within games polygons must be 3 sided/triangles, though typically in animation and 3D design polygons are 4 sided. 
2. Code! All it needs is code so we can start giving the ball commands on what to do and when. 
3. 3D in almost all scenarios will run slower in comparison. Almost anything can slow down a game though, an 8k 2D image with an intense shader/material will put a lot more stress on the game than a normal 3D model.",1.0

And I know the number of tutorials isn't quite as high, but I would recommend Godot to 2D beginners - it's relatively clean and easy to pick up, completely open source, and less than 1GB (I think the Steam version is ~950MB, but the full package straight off the website is closer to 100MB, and yet still fully functional... so very quick and easy to try out). I really like GDScript (Pythonesque) and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive.

I admit I keep getting hung up on optimisation... not just because, like you,  I work in another development area during my day job, but because I want anything I make to be playable on a potato if possible... but it really slows down/halts my progress... need to shoulder my way through that, like you recommend.",2.0

"Hi everyone! I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. 

My role today though focuses on a broader list of things, not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well! I made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out :)",2.0
"This video was really inspiring and insightful to watch! Thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on “Skillset to Interest Framework”.

"Reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters, we had a course that was just making a game, in groups of 5. After week 1 of ""production"" everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing. I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked ""why does it look so pretty?"" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing.",2.0

"I really recommend you checking out a book “The Art of Game Design” and it’s chapter about prototyping. It really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of “Is there a potential in this design?” it’s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode.

Great video. I think more people should know this stuff.",2.0

"Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not.

Learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests.",2.0
"Hey man, I've been building these, let's call them ""prototypes"" for many years. I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned.

"Most of what you're talking about here is called ""abstraction"", despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes.

I'd much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue, but also related past issues as well as potential future ones. In the end, if done well, it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability. It's also a puzzle that I tend to take as personal challenges.",1.0

"Here is my feedback:

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
-The main character could shine more while aiming, maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

Overall I loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so I could try it ♥",2.0

"As a game developer I have always taken the ""boring stuff"" incredibly seriously. If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game, you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire game's campaign or whatever else. In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.

Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it.",1.0

Tip # 3 - Don't make your first game your dream game. It should be your 15 minute crap game. You'll figure out your strengths.
Tip # 4 - Focus on prototyping. It's easier to build in pieces, and funding will motivate you.
Tip # 5 - Build a community. Discord and Social Media.",1.0

"1:03:08 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines.

Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines (which I love because they leave a large impact on the world!) But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often.

That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future.

There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts (or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development.) You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts.

The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks.

A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work... I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game. (I wouldn't have an issue with it but others may.)

Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldn't work when trying to make mineshafts I think.

Edit: I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground.

Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground... I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable.

But going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldn't which I think would be cool... Of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse.",1.0

"Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things. If you're using Unity, learn to use Unity events/C# events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects.",2.0

- health and power pickups
- airborne / aerial targets (such as drones, heavy gunner drones, scout drones, etc.)
- ground targets (such as beam-shooting mechs, enemy balls (similar to the player but a little bit dumb), and laser artilleries.)
- the tank can destroy the turret (since the tank has the same weapons as the turret, but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank.)
- grenade-type weapons and projectiles (i meant by that which has new weapons to choose, such as full-auto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire, or just a single-shot grenade launcher, similar to the M79.)
- the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup :)
- the player can shut down the turret's system

Comment your code. It makes it _SO_ much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes.",2.0

"A BIG tip I have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations. As a coder it's generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion.

If you have fun, then power to you, coding is a hobby after all, but if you're just doing it to save those precious 2ms, it's not worth it by any means, you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency.",1.0

Also, make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line. It is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work, and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary. To that end, I will create empty methods if that's how my model works.",2.0

"yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.

First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of ""wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this"" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. 

So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print ""hello world"", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.

And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.

And last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break? I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500,000 views, and this is definitely not one of them. so if you're watching this, go watch someone else's video or something, this one has way too many views already.",0.0

"The first talk was great. Solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation.

"Was amazing to be involved in this! Hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it, along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls!",2.0
The talks were good. But their personal reflections were amazing. We really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development. The gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster.,2.0
"46:24 This is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice. There was a time in my life where I ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of ""higher priorities"", and it unwittingly spiraled me into 2-3 years of burnout and depression. This is all in retrospect, because at the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but it's extremely clear to me now that you *need* to give yourself the freedom to create and explore; eventually you'll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents, and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work!

"The reason triple AAA games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design.

Thats why I'm revisiting emulation, indie games and a few AAA titles which are worth the money and also the playtime.",2.0
I've been telling my friends this for the past couple years. We are going to see fewer AAA games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the pre-existing games as well. There is just so much competition in this industry.,0.0
"Here is my issue with this.

AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the 'biggest game'. Big being, best graphics, biggest worlds, widest variety be in customization, weapons, vehicles etc. Which will need lots of people and technology naturally. Which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects.

Except when you have games like Undertale, Minecraft (before Microsofts purchase) Goosegame, Goat Simulator, powerwash simulator, etc. Getting loads and loads of sales when they're developed by small teams. These games are very basic graphically, have a very short play time (minecraft an exception), no big budget, no fancy effects, no extraordinary acting. But just simple fun

Heck, id be willing to consider Undertale a masterpiece, and it's a very short game.

Players dont want 'big' they want good.

Yes the newer games look pretty, but i promise best graphics isn't necessarily what gamers are aftee. Best graphics should be icing on the cake. Not the whole cake",1.0

Dani is literally the reason I've started game dev. He might not realize this but he's inspired alot of people including me. And  karlson is literally my dream game...mainly because I grew up playing mirror's edge and other parkour games.,2.0
"underrated? I agree he’s extremely good at game development, but he also has millions of subscribers, millions more viewers, and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm. Not to mention Karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions, and one of the most wishlisted games on steam. Many other solo game-devs out there who pour just as much, if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that. Someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated, there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like Dani. I’m not saying it’s his fault or anything, I watch him and support him, i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated, let alone the most underrated, is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned.",2.0

"I like the nods to 'fanboyism' in this presentation 😄.
I was unlucky that in my college years, you generally only had 1 option in IT. Which were basically programming for databases and networking. While I specifically went to learn coding and (graphics) designing to create games. I learned the graphics part on my own, also because I had a real knack and passion for it. Coding was more difficult, as information to code for gaming or even a game-engine, were hard to come by (or expensive).
Now, almost 2 decades further, our country finally is getting a gaming-industry and there are classes you can follow. I hope I can start in September and hopefully they're not too basic, as I already have some basics.
I already tried creating a game twice, sort of. First time was more than a decade ago, supposed to be a fighting game or beat'em up. I got my character modelled (not textured) and even rigged for facial animation. But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do. So much to consider and take into account. And there wasn't even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed.
Two years ago, I started again, but with another genre I liked and more manageable (for a single game dev),  an arcade racer. Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of (they also made it more user-friendly). And found a decent free game-engine: Godot. Atleast good enough to give me the taste of game-creation and create a tiny concept. I have some videos on my game-dev channel: 'Close Call Racing'on channel 'eyeEmotion'.
I have been on a break from it because of renovations at home, which I have to execute myself. And I'm changing to Unreal Engine, since its change in licensing and it's more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming. I just need that game-dev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when I get stuck and the information I need.",1.0

I am guessing this will take me another 4 months of learning JavaScript before I am able to program my first small game. I am learning JavaScript for web development, but I think I will at the end pivot into mobile development.",1.0

Gun: Floating revolver controlled via mouse, shoot with left click and can do a charged shot with right click. Going this route could make the game too easy, though

"I always tend to make my main characters cute and small. It makes it easier for the players to get attached to them, so as far as audience feedback goes, at least one dude likes the new design.

As for animations with floating hands, most of my characters have floating hands like yours, but mainly use ranged weapons. Limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off, so don't be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it. If you're not too attached to the melee combat, why not focus on ranged instead? Kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side.",2.0

"a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game: ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay. i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well (you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible). i'm very exited to see this games future, so good luck.",2.0
"you should add a ""taunt"" ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound ( the seekers can hear it ) , the hiders can taunt manually but every 2 mins it automatically taunts , because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers",1.0

"**Summary**:
- machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
- there are lots of different ways (""algorithms"") that machines can learn 
- the algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms*

- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs
- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)
- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)

- here is how, in general, supervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input, then the associated output
- you repeat the above step many many times
- eventually, the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and it will predict the output for you

- here is how, in general, unsupervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input (without the associated output)
- you repeat the above step many times
- eventually, the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

* the first example in this video used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

Hope that was useful to someone!

Thanks for the video, really enjoyed it!! :)",1.0
"Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data, it is supervised learning.


Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.


Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious-looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of ""fraud"" and ""not fraud"". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.",1.0

I'm so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning. I appreciate your clear teaching style.,2.0
"Words are not enough to appreciate what you present in your channel, I do believe you are number one in programming.",2.0
"for info: 
1) At 32:52, to avoid UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, we need to train the model with the values of input_dataset. i.e, use X.values instead of X in model.fit(X.values, y). 
2) 42:04, joblib is now a seperate py package. we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearn.externals.

"I love these videos. I just had a tech exec at a Fortune 200 company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of current/emerging technology. I didn't have a great answer for him, but I did mention this series. He was looking for more audio-centric content though. Food for thought, @IBM Technology!",2.0
"So I do like this series, but this confused me because he switched from one output - ""should I buy pizza"" - to another output - ""is this a pizza or a taco"". Is this a fundamental difference in what DL vs ML is able to do? Or that the first output doesn't require as many layers to become a neural network so therefore would always sit at a DL level? Sorry, I think I need to do more study and come back to this video",1.0
Fun-filled tech bites . Loved it,2.0
"I don't completely agree on deep learning explanation, because for weight training, labelling is required. Yes pattern/feature extraction can be debated, but labelled data is required",0.0
"Academically speaking, should AI not be a subset of DL? I think you’ve done a commercial magic trick here.",1.0

With all honesty I never imagined someone explaining complex topics with the dexterity this man has. He is literally an institution and an outstanding teacher. 

The computer graphics and the illustrations are simply perplexing. This guy never evades complexity. He never evades complex arguments. He illustrate the complexity and dive into the exhaustive explanation of the details. 

It's extremely rare to see a professor and a dedicated user to put a lot of effort explaining, animating and describing mathematics the way he does.",1.0

"I always find it interesting that the statement ""logistic regression is a classification method"" is repeated so often, despite 'regression' being right there in the name.  Like decision trees (CART), random forest and other similar methods, there are both regression and classification versions of the method.  In a binary outcome problem, we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads (1) and 1-p of coming up tails (0).  We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression; the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)",1.0
"I'm taking a machine learning course and this is what I needed to completely understand each method. Great video, concise and easy to follow. Thanks!",2.0
"It may surprise some people, but logistic REGRESSION is in fact a regression model. The output is continuous: it's a probability. Of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier. Just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output. So the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut.",1.0
"You can also get multi-class classification where the output is more then 2, also you can use neural networks for classification also.",1.0

"Also it may be wise to learn MATLAB to a fairly advanced level before doing ML. The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one,  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it.

"You should learn machine learning even if you don't intend to be a machine learning engineer.   ML is a tool, an important one that can help make sense from data.   In the future,  knowing how to use ML as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use Excel today.   It doesn't mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesn't know how to use one.",2.0
"ML reminds me Big Data's hype few years ago, some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it, so they wanted to ""train"" themselves puting an Hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on, until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing. It just allows to solve some problems (and not all) in a more efficient way than other methods.

I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is, what it can do, hardware requierments and what gains it can provide, so  they can know if they really need it. Then, maybe, they should learn it in depth, but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements.

"This lecture is awesome and really inspiring. I've been a fan now for years now Lex, and I'm really happy to see your success. I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of ""One Shot Learning"" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim.",2.0

So each time I try to make classification on the target column I get a failure notice telling me that my training and test shape are not the same. 


How can I make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me? Or how can I adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program?",0.0

"Great introduction. Just one point at 2:02:30 Tuple for single column is passed in wrong way and thats why it returned data series. It should be df.loc[:,(""START*"",) instead of  df.loc[:,(""START*"") to get the dataframe. As in Pyhton () brackets are used for expressions or for functions. (2+3) will be evaluated into 5 and (""START*"") will be evaluated into string ""START*"" and thus when there is single element in a TUPLE it must be represented with comma at the end.",1.0

it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0.0

"Correction:
4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation: 
B. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
A. The Bias is added
D. The result is fed to an activation function
C. Specific Neuron is activated

Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:
1. Divya Maskar
2. Kartik Singhal
3. Michael Ipinolu
Congratulations to all the winners! They've won an Amazon voucher worth INR 500.",1.0

"Hello sir, thank you for your videos. It really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist. 😄 
The model in default method is 99.65% in train and 99.4% in test. Whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 99.4% to 75% therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model. 
Yet, kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model.
Thank you for your guidance.",2.0

"The hard part about Machine Learning is not the how but the what. I can plot learning curves very easily, but reading them is another story. That's why I like to focus my ML videos on the concepts rather than the code. Chances are that the code is doable in two lines. But if you can't understand the output (or why your data might give you certain kinds of output) you're wasting time and resources",1.0
"Just about to finish my first year studying statistics. A short course was about machine learning so I have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video. We got to use and tweak different types of predictor models. We split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data, which included the outcome variable, to build the models and the test data, which didn't include the outcome variable, to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable",2.0

"Hello, how are you? 
From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic. 
However, if you want to reach an even wider audience, considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English, I suggest:
1. To associate the subtitles, even if in English, as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery;
2. That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way, as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language.

"Excellent resource Sir!
Can you please explain all the sub fields in AI/ ML/ DL like NLP, computer vision etc. & any other major part that I don't know even. 

In software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers. Like for web development frontend technologies are same html, css, js. For backend one may choose a programming language (php, node js, asp.net) and a database. 
Again for mobile developers they may choose Android, IOS or cross platform (React native, flutter) with database knowledge, APIs & basic knowledge on how web works.

My question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev, can an AI/ ML engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only NLP engineer (knows very less about Computer Vision) or Computer Vision engineer (knows very less about NLP)?",2.0

"I would also like to point out that actually *understanding* machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics (as was mentioned as a benefit, being part of something), will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability + statistics. In fact, at my university, in order to enrol in the first machine learning course, you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus (with proofs, as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops), one or two courses in linear algebra, and 2 courses in statistics. 
That’s not to say it’s impossible to use ML without that, of course it isn’t. However, it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge (much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML). 
So yes, you will be “a part of something”, in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with, but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level, or be generating their own custom models",1.0
"In my eyes, the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml. In many cases I would eagerly wait for about 5-6 hours for the model to train, to see it not work at all in the way I intended. I'd keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the  code to see its performance not getting better at all.",0.0

Cons : You have to work

"I'm taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book (not related to the course) and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting. The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didn't use python to do it, I was using Stata, but you could use R to do the same thing and now days I'm sure they are teaching python in economics. At any rate, even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful. Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing (including the textbook) all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesn't use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about? IDK.

I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix, Google, Amazon or etc to help suggest something (or something along those lines). Well, that's all fine and good, but I don't work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill. The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and won't go into. Thus, kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term, and medium term. When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chart/graph with a line through it e.g. the trend line. Technically, you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML, so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating.  Or, other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age, salary, and whether or not they bought a car. You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes $70k will they buy a car? It will be based off a percentage, of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not.  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes. And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc. So, it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they don't really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects.     

Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predication/trend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using. They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset. This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they don't teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a small-medium business or say your website has x amount of traffic, etc.  

I'm often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter. For example, in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression. Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 5-7 factors. But to be honest the housing sample is a great example, but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result (ie my own project). Also, the examples often are intuitive, like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I don't even need data or run ML on it to know that. It can get de-motiving at times. So, the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true. Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacation/travel during summer. Also, they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter. It's 200+ pages like that. Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying, ""Now, of course the real life data will not look anything like this, but you get the idea""...    I am kind of stuck in-between smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want. I'm tempted to skip 20 hours or 200+ pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but can't stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section, or whatever. 

So far, it's like learning basic Statistics but in Python.",1.0
"I'm a data scientist and 95% of my job is data collection and preparation, it's still a cool job but it's not all model development",2.0
"at first I thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months, with some coding experience. i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months.
and guess what, in reality it took me 1+ year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem.
time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required.
if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field :
first to learn data structures and algorithms, programming logic.
then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search, reverse linked list, string manipulation..., this will help you so much to improve coding skills.
the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way.
second learn some basic calculus and statistics, linear algebra, probability, dot product,  gradient descent...
third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills.",1.0
"The only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop. It was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases, it might go on for even a week with GPUs. It pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company.

"I've worked for about 2 years with ML/computer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated. When I started out I was frustrated that I couldn't dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but I realized there are a lot of ""boring"" things that need to be in place before that's even relevant (data curation, annotation, testing frameworks etc just to name a few). There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldn't even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD. 

I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning ""tools for the sake of tools"" and solving problems though. As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh",2.0
"I come from a physics background, and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory, trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can. A lot of colleagues in my department don't understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop. During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity, which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects. Now that I'm finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want. Amazing content you put there, mate! Thanks from Brazil!",2.0
"Back when I was learning to code I didn’t know anything or what to do and how to do it. I asked a friend of mine how I could what books I should read etc. first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say “you don’t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks, you just need to know what is possible” and that really reasonated  with me because once you know what is possible, you can think of a problem and as the video states “learn by doing”, my friend said to work I’m projects I want to solve or replicate and implement what I have learned that way. Rather than sitting around reading these books.",1.0
I really like the point about engineering toolboxes. I think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from. I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap. Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time.,2.0

"This is great. Focus is key. A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate.

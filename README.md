# Deep Learning (PyTorch examples)

In progress...

This repository contains demonstrations of the following deep-learning techniques implemented with Pytorch.

- mlp: Multiple Layer Perceptions (deep feedforward neural network)
	- regression (LDW data) 
	- classification (LDW data) 	
- cnn: 2D Convolutional Neural Network
	- classification (mask detection)
	- classification (MNIST data)
- rnn: Recurrent Neural Network	
	- rnn: classification (RAVDESS audio)
	- lstm: classification (Youtube comments) 
- atten: Attention Model
	-  transformers (language translation)
- gan: Generative Adversarial Network
	- generate images (MNIST)
	- generate covariates (LDW data)

Note: the code and examples in the repository are for pedagogical purposes and thus have not been enhanced for efficiency and performance.

A collection of DL modules implemented from scratch using NumPy can be found in another repository here: https://github.com/weili-code/DeepLearning_numpy/tree/main
